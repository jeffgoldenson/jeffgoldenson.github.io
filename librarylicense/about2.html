						<div class="toggle-button"><h4 class="delta pointer">What is Library License?</h4></div>
							<div class="toggle-pane">
								<p> Library License is a contractual rider an author can negotiate with a publisher that gives one online copy to public libraries after the book has stopped selling.</p>
								
								<p>The license is triggered by a set of conditions that the author negotiates with the publisher, including: book sales have dropped to a particular level, a new edition has come out, a specified period of time has passed, etc.</p>
		
								<p>Once the Library License comes into effect, a digital copy of the book is made available to participating public and school libraries. These libraries offer that Library Licensed copy -- one reader at a time -- through their normal managed system for lending e-books. The book is still in copyright, and is protected by whatever Digital Rights Management system the library uses.</p>
							</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="toggle-button"><h4 class="delta pointer">Who's working on it?</h4></div>
							<div class="toggle-pane">
								<p>It’s a collaboration between the Harvard Library Innovation Lab and the Berkman Center for Internet and Society.  Its development was funded by the Harvard Library Lab, which is made possible through the generous support of the Arcadia Fund.</p>
							</div>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						<div class="toggle-button"><h4 class="delta pointer">What problem does Library License solve?</h4></div>
							<div class="toggle-pane">
								<p>Once books stop selling, they become unavailable. But even though there may not be any more buyers of the book, there may well be potential readers. Library License gives books a second life after they are no longer commercially viable.</p>
							</div>
					</div>
			
				<div>
						<div class="toggle-button"><h4 class="delta pointer">What is the Library License?</h4></div>
							<div class="toggle-pane">
								<p>Technically, it’s a set of legal provisions gathered into an addendum -- a rider --  to the author’s contract with the publisher. The provisions specify the conditions under which the Library License comes into effect. Additionally, the author can ask that the work take on a Creative Commons open access license that specifies some permitted exemptions from the standard copyright the work enjoys.</p>
								
								<p>Library License is also a distribution mechanism. Once the conditions are met, an electronic copy of the book is given to an institution that manages the process by which a single copy is made available to participating libraries. (This institution might be a large library, library association, or other reliable archival institution.)</p>
		
								<p>At that point, any public or school library that wants to make a copy available to its users can do so. One reader at a time is allowed to read the work for free.</p>
							</div>
					</div>
					
					
					<div>
						<div class="toggle-button"><h4 class="delta pointer">What does Library License mean for me as a reader?</h4></div>
							<div class="toggle-pane">
								<p> Some works that are still in copyright will become available through your library for you to read online for free. .</p>
								
								<p>Your ability to download and copy these works will be limited in the same ways other books provided by your library are, unless the author of the work has specified that the book will be available under a Creative Commons license (learn more about <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>).</p>

					<div>
						<div class="toggle-button"><h4 class="delta pointer">What does Library License mean for me as an author?</h4></div>
							<div class="toggle-pane">
								<p>When your book is no longer making you or your publisher money, it will still be available through public and school libraries.</p>
								
								<p>You will retain whatever copyright you had, although you can optionally provide copies to libraries under a Creative Commons license (learn more about <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>).</p>

								<p> Library License is a contractual rider you negotiate with an author. It provides limited online access to the work through libraries after it is no longer earning substantial money for you. It does not by itself affect your license to the print version of the work.</p>

								<p> A stream of in-copyright works will become available to you to distribute through your usual e-book distribution mechanism. This mechanism will permit only one simultaneous copy be lent at a time, along with whatever other digital rights management your mechanism imposes.</p>
								
								<p>If you already offer an e-copy of a work that has come under Library License, you now will have one more simultaneous copy to offer.</p>
		
								<p>If the Library License includes the adoption of a Creative Commons license, you will be able to offer this work without the DRM restrictions that the CC license supersedes.</p>
							</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="toggle-button"><h4 class="delta pointer">What counts as a library?</h4></div>
							<div class="toggle-pane">
								<p> We intend to include public and school libraries in the United States. Generally these are easy to identify. There are, however, edge cases. We are working on the specifics. When in doubt, we intend to err on the side of generosity, so long as the library has a reliable mechanism for controlling distribution.</p>
							</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="toggle-button"><h4 class="delta pointer">Are Library Licensed works copyright-free?</h4></div>
							<div class="toggle-pane">
								<p> Not at all. The author and/or publisher retain the copyright on the work. Libraries are merely given the right to distribute one (1) digital copy of that work.  A specified number of electronic copies will be made available to an agreed-upon national distributor who will provide control over the number of simultaneous check-outs.</p>
							</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="toggle-button"><h4 class="delta pointer">What about Digital Rights Management (DRM)?</h4></div>
							<div class="toggle-pane">
								<p> Licensed works will be made available through whatever secure digital distribution system each library uses.  Library License relies on those those systems to provide some level of digital rights management.  </p>
							</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="toggle-button"><h4 class="delta pointer">How big a step is Library License?</h4></div>
							<div class="toggle-pane">
								<p>The Project does not seek to disrupt current or future business models for either publishers or authors.  Rather, the Library License is envisioned as a means of ensuring that libraries have access to old and new digital content in a way that complements publishers’ and authors’ rights in the content they create.  Library Licensed works will still be available for purchase, but there will be some number made available for public consumption.  </p>
						
								<p>We passionately believe authors should be able to easily make their livings as authors.  We also believe there is a point in the lifecycle of a work where it is of greater value to both publishers and authors if more people can be exposed to it.  This is a win for all parties.</p>
							</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="toggle-button"><h4 class="delta pointer">May LL apply already-published works?</h4></div>
							<div class="toggle-pane">
								<p> Library License is seen as a flexible instrument.  In time, we hope to explore Library Licensing in print, back catalog works.  </p>
							</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="toggle-button"><h4 class="delta pointer">Who manages the Library License?  Who is the intermediary?</h4></div>
							<div class="toggle-pane">
								<p> At this stage, we have not identified a governing body who will look after the license and/or host and serve library licensed works to libraries across the US.</p>
							</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="toggle-button"><h4 class="delta pointer">How does distribution work?</h4></div>
							<div class="toggle-pane">
								<p> We have not worked out the mechanics of a distribution system.  One possible piece of the process is that at the time of printing, one digital proof may be sent to a trusted secure server where it remains in dark storage until the license becomes active.  At that point, the intermediary distributes the work. </p>

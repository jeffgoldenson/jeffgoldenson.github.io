\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 Who manages the Library License?
\b0 \
At this stage, without sufficient market feedback on the interest and viability of the concept, we have not identified a governing body who will look after the license and/or host and serve library licensed works to libraries across the US.  \

We find deep resonance with the Digital Public Library of America and see them and others as possible entities to approach.  }

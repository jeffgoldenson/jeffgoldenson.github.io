<p class="binderItem"><strong>What is Library License?-1</strong><br/>What is Library License?<br/>
The Library License is an agreement an author with her/his publisher that after a work has passed a specified threshold – sales have dropped below a certain level, a substantially new edition has come out, or a certain number of years have passed, etc. – every public and school library will be allowed to distribute one electronic copy of that work through the library’s usual digital distribution system.<br/>

It’s the opposite of a self destruct mechanism.  <br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Copyright</strong><br/>Copyright<br/>
The Average American lives = 78.5 years.     <br/>
For works created after 1978, copyright protects works lasts for the life of the author, plus an additional 70 years.   <br/>
Library License is an effort to create a space in the digital world where works, still under copyright, may be securely made available to the public. <br/>
If an author publishes their work today, at the age of 40, this work will not enter the public domain until 70 + (78.5 year lifespan - current age of author (40) = 38.5, pl...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Why</strong><br/>Why?<br/>
The Library License is envisioned as a means of ensuring that libraries have access to old and new digital content in a way that complements publishers’ and authors’ rights in the content they create. <br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Benefits</strong><br/>Benefits<br/>
1 The work is archived in public, keeping it accessible to the occasional user who wants it.<br/>
2 The work might help build demand for other works by the author.<br/>
3 <br/>
Because the digital copy is released with restrictions on the number of simultaneous copies, the length of the lending period, and (potentially) the inability to print selections, it might drive incremental demand for copies printed on-demand by the publisher.</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>What counts as a library</strong><br/>What counts as a library?<br/>
A library is a branch of a public library or library within an educational system. We are working on specifying this in more detail.  <br/>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>What are the thresholds?</strong><br/>What are the thresholds?<br/>
The threshold can be whatever the author and publisher agree to. Typically, they specify within the following parameters: <br/>
1 Sales: The number of copies being sold has slowed to a specified trickle.<br/>
2 Time: A specified amount of time has passed.<br/>
3 Obsolescence: A substantially new edition has come out, or, possibly, a second new edition has come out.<br/>
4 Event: A print book goes out of print.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>DRM</strong><br/>What about DRM?<br/>
The License requires libraries to make a copy available through whatever digital distribution system they use. Those systems provide some level of digital rights management.  <br/>
Are Library Licensed works copyright-free?<br/>
Not at all. The author and/or publisher retain the copyright on the work. Libraries are merely given the right to distribute that copyrighted work.<br/>
<br/>
One digital coy is released to every library in America.  Only one copy may be checked out at a time, <br/>
A specified n...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Non-Disruptive</strong><br/>Non-Disruptive<br/>
The Project does not seek to disrupt current or future business models for either publishers or authors.  Rather, the Library License is envisioned as a means of ensuring that libraries have access to old and new digital content in a way that complements publishers’ and authors’ rights in the content they create.  Library Licensed works will still be available for purchase, but there will be some number made available for public consumption.  <br/>

We passionately believe authors shou...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Front of Catalog or Back of Catalog?</strong><br/>Front of Catalog or Back of Catalog?<br/>
Library License is seen as a flexible instrument.    <br/>
<br/>
Does this apply only to works in the contracts stage?<br/>
Hopefully not, depending on uptake perhaps discussions may be able to happen over time to explore Library Licensing, older, “back of catalog” works.  <br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Governing Body</strong><br/>Who manages the Library License?<br/>
At this stage, without sufficient market feedback on the interest and viability of the concept, we have not identified a governing body who will look after the license and/or host and serve library licensed works to libraries across the US.  <br/>
<br/>
We find deep resonance with the Digital Public Library of America and see them and others as possible entities to approach.  </p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Distribution</strong><br/>Distribution<br/>
We have not worked out the specifics of the distribution mechanism system.  One possible process is a work may be completed, and at pre-press, one digital proof may be sent to a trusted secure server where it remain in dark storage until the license becomes active.  At that point, distribution of </p>

That’s where you come in.  We don’t know.  Do you?  </p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Will they come?</strong><br/>Will they come?<br/>
We’re putting this instrument into the marketplace to see if there is interest.  <br/>

Our goal is to leverage the library, it’s legacy as a cultural institutions and prominence in our collective imagination as more than just advocate for change, but as a creator of new technology and policy. to shape the future of information. <br/>

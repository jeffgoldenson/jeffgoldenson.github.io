<h1>Start Listening</h1>

<h2>Listening to The Community</h2>

<p>Aaron and I began our work in the Library with the OWL co-curricular. Folks would head to the dining hall, grab lunch, and take it back to the Library for our discussion. It was really important to </p>

<p>It took the form of regular lunch discussions students. At the same time, I was getting learning the about the politics to be aware of, the people to guide me. That blossomed into a Thursday evening gathering.</p>

<p>OWL was where we began the community. Our primary goal fun and community. was about the Library Together, we were building the culture that powered everything that followed. </p>

<h2>Listening to The Library </h2>

<p>Looking at our circulation records and the Library, and just observing, it was our power drills in our tools collection 🧰, that far and away saw the most traffic. This wasn’t a surprise, we’re an engineering school . But I’m not gonna lie, it was a little deflating. Any way you sliced it their usage dwarfed book borrowing. </p>

<p>There’s a big loft-building culture in Olin’s Dorms. The Library Drills can be “taken out,” all other drills are owned by shops or labs and don’t walk. </p>

<p>To make the Greenhouse create energy, at root there must be a cycle of creativity that keeps going ‘round. energy must move through it. Greenhouse an engine - something in motion that can grow and change — there must be energy that moves through the system. it has to be a mutually rewarding collaboration between participants. </p>

<h2>A Creative Economy</h2>

<p>Staff have experience and perspective, an ability to get things done, creativity, and a P-💳. Students have magic ✨ - they bring the weird energy.

<p>Some projects are strong and enduring: ACRONYM - steady state</p>

<p>Some surprise - The power of an Alumni Card game that Gets people to Laugh! </p>

<p>Some take on a life of their own - Faux-mencement. </p>

<p>Some fall flat - The Olin Snapshot - our collaborative newspaper with Marketing. </p>

<p>The falling flat here is important. It highlights the lows. What’s so great about working in your own pond is the upsides are so large (“Hey, check out these 🌊!”) and the downsides so small (“Failure 💥 with friends!”). Sometimes things cost a few cents and a little pride, but you get back on the horse. The Greenhouse is a training-ground in creative risk-taking. It’s a rollercoaster. </p>

<p>Here’s the Greenhouse’s fundamental proposition: excitement builds when varied constituents agree to pool 📇 rolodexes and resources and try stuff. </p>

<p>Fasten your seatbelt, this is Drivers Ed. A College is a perfect parking lot to practice in.</p>

<p>This is about them making decisions</p>

<p>Students can’t learn how to drive unless they’re driving. </p>

“After the first telegram came to Berlin asking about going to Black Mountain, a long letter several pages long came in German from Ted Dreir in which the words “this is a pioneering adventure” -- you know it had just started, and when we came across this word “pioneering” we both said “This is our place.” You know, leaving the Bauhaus, which was certainly a pioneering place, we said this is a kind of ….to continue this.  And I believe that this played a great part in our staying on because it was this pioneering.  There was nothing and there was a chance to build something up and in other places there was already a framework and you had to fit in, squeeze in, and so that made Black Mountain especially desirable and we loved it for that reason.”

<p>Our mission was to “build something up.” The students didn’t want to fit into a framework, they wanted to create the framework. And that pioneering provocation and spirit has sustained student engagement.</p>

<p>Only retro-actively could we name this ”m<em>aking space for making change</em>, we had much more open feelings “<strong>Making Space for Making <em>Interesting</em>.</strong>”</p>

<p>In this universe of creating our framework, having no fixed definition of success and failure. What we were proposing not a goal post, but a path. A way of traveling. We were indeed making space - an audience, some ears - but </p>

<h2>Share the Wins + Shed the Losses</h2>

<p>Institutions can’t change if they can’t make mistakes. A while ago I was at the MIT Media Lab and there was a town hall meeting. Someone asked a question about the nature of The Lab (how it worked, how they should describe it to.). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_P._Reed">David P. Reed</a>, a lifer in research, stood up and gave an answer that stuck.</p>

<pre><code class="code-highlighted code-html">+ Corporations hate risk

+ The Media Lab Shares the wins and Sheds the Losses </code></pre>

<p>During the day I was Library Director. In that role, I couldn’t chase high-risk (and high reward) ideas. Libraries run on trust. Patrons trust the Library’s steadfast and equitable access to resources. </p>

<p>I had to keep the train running - ensuring , predictability and access to resources so central to the value of Libraries. </p>

<p>After 5pm, I could be Jeff. This non-trained Librarian brought on to reinvigorate the Olin College Library. however, But if I could allocate a very small corner of my budget to experimentation, and in the evenings, meet up with Students as Jeff, not Library Director. </p>

<h1>Work in the Margins</h1>

<h2>of Time</h2>

<h3>The Margins of the Academic Calendar</h3>

<figure><img src="semesters_Seasons.png"/></figure>

<p>Daily - Lunch!</p>

<p>Weekly - Is there a particularly light afternoon course wise? Act then. </p>

<h3>Working in the Margins of the Curriculum </h3>

<p>We operate outside the course schedule. Olin Workshop on the Library (OWL), the precursor to the GH 🌱 began during lunch, moved to evenings, and we ultimately landed on Wednesdays. Wednesdays at Olin are light on courses. Tuesday’s a “weekend night” for the students. </p>

<h2>of Space</h2>

<h3>Working in the Margins of the Library </h3>

<p>As a small Library in a Project-Based Learning Engineering College, our Library never found great student demand for quiet study.</p>

<h1>This is Show Business</h1>

<h2>We’re not in the Tell Business</h2>

<p>It’s hard to make the change we wanted to see in the College with just talking. We had to show it. We were chasing a vibe, something ineffable. Leadership needed to feel it to “buy” it. And that meant we were in the multi-sensory experience business. </p>

<p>Let’s take a cafe. What evokes that state of being is: </p>

<ul>
	<li>👃 Smelling fresh brewed aroma</li>
	<li>🤏 Feeling a warm mug in your had</li>
	<li>👂Listing to the grinding of beans beans</li>
</ul>

<h1>College after COVID-19</h1>

<h2>Why Off-Line College?</h2>

<p>Looking ahead a year or two, it’s not difficult to imagine a scene like this:</p>

<pre><code class="code-highlighted code-html">INT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR&#39;S OFFICE


					PARENT
I&#39;m not gonna lie, money&#39;s tight. Is it worth sending ___ to a residential college?  There&#39;re a lot of great online programs now...  


				GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
I hear this question a lot. 

If you can make the finances work, it&#39;s the community experience that surrounds the courses that makes such a difference -- the eating together, the mentorship, the late night conversations, the new things to try.
 
___ is still discovering herself.</code></pre>

<h4>What’s the unique value of being on campus and how can we amplify it?</h4>

<p>One great value of being a part of an on-campus community is the ability to shape that community. Students efforts to build and shape community and climate of their four-year home</p>

<pre><code class="code-highlighted code-html">INT. FRONT DOOR OF COLLEGE


			STUDENT
Woohoo! It’s great to be back on campus!  So what’s new?

			COLLEGE
Uhmm…</code></pre>

<h2>So, What’s New?</h2>

<p>When we all return to college, will it be business as usual? That feels somehow tone-deaf to the times and anti-climactic. </p>

<p>There will be change, so let’s get ahead of it. Students and parents need new reasons to enroll, new human experiences in space only available at residential college. </p>

<p>Let’s re-run this scene. </p>

<pre><code class="code-highlighted code-html">BEGIN FLASHBACK:

INT. FRONT DOOR OF COLLEGE


			STUDENT
Woohoo! It’s great to be back on campus!  So what’s new?

			COLLEGE
Se don&#39;t know so we carved out a space where you can help us figure it out. </code></pre>

<h2>A New Place</h2>

<p>Space - square footage - is one of the most precious things in college. Space is proxy for “The College”. Good real-estate means “The College” values what you’re doing. </p>

<p>Making Space that students co-own with staff. A Studio. </p>

<h2>A New Collaboration</h2>

<figure><img src="triangle-animation-02.gif"/></figure>

<p>To enable new kinds of channels for green lighting “productions”.</p>

<h2>A 🕹️ for College</h2>

<p>Colleges do not invite change. But what if they did? An arcade game provides a 🕹️ to control the action. Where’s the 🕹️ for college? </p>

<ul>
	<li>What if there was a new institutional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance">affordance</a> — think library, but far smaller — that students co-created with staff.</li>
	<li>What if its job was to design and “iterate” on any and all corners of the college</li>
	<li>What if students felt the ownership and agency to “hack” the college experience.</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong><em> Making Space for Making Change</em></strong> documents our efforts to create a different kind of college affordance. </p>

<h1>Practice Making Change</h1>

<p>As we 🌍 grapple with so many crises and questions at the planetary scale, very little is clear — but there will be change. Within a college, the classroom may be an environment to cultivate a disposition towards change, but it has drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
	<li>it must be choreographed to fit the semester </li>
	<li>it demands a deeply scaffolded structure to deliver learning objectives</li>
	<li>it frequently demands external partnerships </li>
	<li>it uses grades to propel action a propellant </li>
</ul>

<h2>What is Changemaking?…</h2>

<figure><video src="changemaking.mp4" controls/></figure>

<p>What this is all about is building a new, student-driven, staff-supported culture of college. And it’s a constellation of often lively and frequently fun experiences outside the curriculum — coffee shops, retreats and something like clubs. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>READER</strong></p>

<p>This sounds like window dressing. Why does this matter?</p>

<p><strong>Olin</strong></p>

<p>It doesn’t, exactly. But it’s practice. It’s all a warm-up for those times where there really is a window to make bigger change. You’ve got the toolset. It’s how you learn to make change on the stuff that does matter. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have to get practical and figure out a way to do work. To act. be realistic. </p>

<ul>
	<li>The new begins small &amp; temporary</li>
	<li>Early change never touches mission-critical elements</li>
	<li>Something.</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>

<p>We are cultivating a student-disposition towards making change. <a href="https://www.ashoka.org/en-us">Folks</a> have come to call it changemaking. More specifically, this is an education in changemaking. </p>

<ul>
	<li>Changemaking starts small</li>
	<li>Changemaking starts with something personally relevant</li>
	<li>Changemaking doesn’t begin with solving grand challenges</li>
	<li><ul>
			<li>Changemaking doesn’t begin with solving grand challenges</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Changemaking is practiced </li>
	<li>Changemaking starts at home</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Conditions for Change </h2>

<p>This is about building the conditions to cultivate student-initiated change. </p>

<p>We need to create a home on our campus where hyper lo“changemaking” is </p>

<p>In this performance, administrators and faculty are real actors, playing themselves. They all care for the welfare of the college that supports them. They need to be convinced. Their politics need to be real stuff. </p>

<h2>Making Change</h2>

<p>What follow are strategies for making change in your institution. They are drawn from the Olin College Library and efforts College-wide. </p>

<p>Part I. From a Traditional Library Culture to Something Different</p>

<p>From a Culture has </p>

<p>“The Library” needed to change. And who better to make the changes than students. </p>

<p>The goal: Build a Library culture where students feel:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ownership</li>
	<li>Agency</li>
	<li>Creative</li>
	<li>Amplified</li>
	<li>Olin-y</li>
</ul>

<p>Usher back Olin’s original culture of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ownership</li>
	<li>Agency</li>
	<li>Creative</li>
	<li>Amplified</li>
	<li>Olin-y </li>
</ul>

<p>Build a college culture where students feel:</p>

<figure><video src="izzy-comp.mp4" controls/></figure>

<p>I wanted students to be together outside the dorms. It wasn’t happening. Had to find the draw</p>

<p>There was a moment about twos years into my four years running the Library Director the Library when I realized that the change we were making in the Library, was actually just one long slow performance. A show. </p>

<p>I had a background in Libraries, I helped stand up a <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/">Library Lab</a>, but I didn’t hold a degree in Library Science. </p>

<p>I </p>

<h2>We’re not in the Tell Business</h2>

<p>It’s hard to make the change we wanted to see in the College with just talking. We had to show it. We were chasing a vibe, something ineffable. Leadership needed to feel it to “buy” it. And that meant we were in the multi-sensory experience business. </p>

<p>Let’s take a cafe. What evokes that state of being is: </p>

<ul>
	<li>👃 Smelling fresh brewed aroma</li>
	<li>🤏 Feeling a warm mug in your had</li>
	<li>👂Listing to the grinding of beans beans</li>
</ul>

<p>And more. The convincing case for change needs to be felt. </p>

<p>What follows are dispatches from what we’ve learned, framed as suggestions for how you might proceed if you’d like to make some change. </p>

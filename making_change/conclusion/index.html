<h1>Making Space for Making Change</h1>

<h2>A 🕹️ for College</h2>

<p>Colleges do not invite change. But what if they did? </p>

<p>The Joystick is a wonderful interface. It was designed for the hands of pilots and fell into the hands of kids at the arcade. Incredibly intuitive, their operation quickly becomes 2nd nature. </p>

<p>An arcade game provides a 🕹️ to control the action. Where’s the 🕹️ for college? What if there was a new institutional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance">affordance</a> inviting cross-cutting collaborations that make change?</p>

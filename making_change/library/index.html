<h1>Making Space for Making Culture</h1>

<p>In the Fall of ’14 the provost decided January’s Faculty Retreat would be on the future of the Library. Aaron Hoover and I hosted the event with the help of <a href="http://www.olin.edu/faculty/profile/jessica-townsend/">Jessica Townsend</a> and <a href="https://sarahendren.com/">Sara Hendren</a>. Sara named it: “Making Space for Making Culture,” which was the roots of the name for this doc.</p>

<h2>Library as Amplifier</h2>

<p>The Olin Library needed to be a library. We needed to preserve quiet study, facilitate research and support learning. But we also believed the Library could amplify the community in new ways. We wouldn’t get a better chance than the retreat to hear what the Faculty had to say. </p>

<h2>Speculative Stories</h2>

<figure><img src="speculative-stories-small.jpg"/></figure>

<p>The most consequential thing the sixty of us did that day was paste-up a newspaper, <em>Speculative Stories</em>, in about in hour. In preparation we designed and printed off poster-size “broadsheet” templates, each with the banner, blocking for articles and images, and section headings. The four sections were entrepreneurship, curriculum, public engagement and opinion.</p>

<p>The job was to imagine and narrate the new programs, events and opportunities to define the future of The Library. Introducing the activity, we encouraged folks to think “<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1668945/wanna-figure-out-if-your-product-is-any-good-think-like-a-news-editor">newsworthy</a>” — what are the library futures you’d pick up a paper to read about. This was the arc: </p>

<ol>
	<li>Take 20 minutes </li>
	<li>Write a few stories</li>
	<li>Start with the headline</li>
	<li>Paste your stories in the the sections they belong</li>
	<li>Grab some ☕ </li>
	<li>Read the paper</li>
</ol>

<h2>A Co-Created Narrative of Next Steps</h2>

<p><em>Speculative Stories</em> was useful in two ways. First, it surfaced what we as a library needed to amplify:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Community</strong> — people wanted a cross-roads for more staff, faculty and student interaction. </li>
	<li><strong>Flexibility</strong> — we needed to employ Olin’s commitment to prototyping and iteration in our pursuit of the Library. We needed maximum flexibility to try these activities out. </li>
	<li><strong>Action</strong> — There was an energy in the room that day, a chance to try something new at the College. We needed to act fast to keep that energy alive. </li>
</ul>

<p>Second, as an artifact<em>Speculative Stories</em> provided cover. The last step in the weeks after the event: the transcribing, producing and distributing of a real newspaper was critical. A dispatch of writing from the Faculty Retreat lended authority. Printed words are harder to refute. They’re data. <em>Speculative Stories</em> gave us license to act.</p>

<h1>ACRONYM</h1>

<h2>College Runs on Coffee</h2>

<p>Evidenced by its frequency in <em>Speculative Stories</em>, one desire came through loud and clear: <strong> Coffee! </strong></p>

<p>It’s not that there was no coffee at Olin, but the topic was a bit more fraught for a number of reasons. <em>Speculative Stories</em> gave the students and I the ability to do something about it. </p>

<p>So I asked them, “what should we do?”</p>

<h2>Enter ACRONYM</h2>

<figure><img src="acronym1.jpg"/></figure>

<p>Free Coffee! </p>

<p>Wednesday’s 12:30-2pm</p>

<p>Milas Hall Atrium</p>

<p>Fresh-brewed &amp; Served by Students</p>

<p>Tea too </p>

<p>Pour-over coffee at the front door of the College, poured by novice baristas’ having fun. It’s slow, inefficient and originally we were nervous.</p>

<figure><img src="acronym3.jpg"/></figure>

<p>But then we realized this was the price of free. You don’t pay in money, you pay in time. Waiting in line together, talking. And it amplified the community-building goals. </p>

<p>Four seasons in, ACRONYM is an enduring Wednesday fixture, fully “owned” and operated by students. </p>

<h2>Popping Up in Public, and Leaving</h2>

<p>A note about the site. Part of the coup of ACRONYM was its temporary takeover of a vacant desk at the front door of the college. That was off limits to students. But there’s a skirting of politics with impermanence. ACRONYM pops up, makes a convivial cafe, and is gone in three hours. </p>

<p>An Important Day. One Day </p>

<p>At the Outset of the Library </p>

<h2>Making Space for Making Culture</h2>

<p>We needed the main floor of our library to open up &amp; welcome event production from across the college, depending on day, time, season. And then reset. We needed to “make” space to make culture. </p>

<p>So we put everything on wheels. regular castors, and step-down castors. There’s little special about this, other than we retrofitted our existing bookshelves with wheels. We did it scrappy and it became a many hands Friday job. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bagelsaurus.com/#menu">Salt Bagels w/ Honey Rosemary Cream Cheese</a> were just a cameo for the bookshelf-making event. But they quickly became legend so we brought ‘em back about once a semester (at great expense) to play the staring role in our Community Breakfasts to kick off the Semester. But it was worth every penny. </p>

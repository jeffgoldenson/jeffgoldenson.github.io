<p>Joya tossed <em>Pennies for Elephants </em>at me to read to her. We did a do-over, and she passed it to me and asked me to read it. Dragging my feet, I obliged. I’m glad I did. </p>

<p>Lita Judge’s, <em>Pennies for Elephants </em> , 2009 The book opens with a paperboy shouting “Pennies for elephants!” Henry and Dorothy, our two kid guides through this adventure stop to read the <em>Boston Post</em> article. </p>

<blockquote>
<h3>Author Bases Story on True Events </h3>

<p>What unfolds is a story based on the 1914 newspaper headlines about the children of Boston raising more than $6000 to buy the first elephants fr the Franklin Park Zoo. The zoo had twenty bears, three elk, a deer, and a monkey, but no elephants. During a time when ethnicity and social class divided people, this campaign to support the elephant fund, by kids and for kids, prodded a cause which united the city. The (<em>Boston</em>) <em>Post’s</em> newly appointed “elephant editor” ran strifes every day from March to June. Every donation, from one cent up, was acknowledged in a daily list of contributors. The author was intrigued by how the elephant fund campaign inspired children to work together for a community cause. </p>

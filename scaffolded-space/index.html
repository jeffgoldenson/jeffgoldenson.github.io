<h1>scaffolded space</h1>

<h3>a blueprint for temporary public gathering</h3>

<p>If you wanted to be with a group of people in a safe, sheltered environment, where would you go right now (Fall 2020)? </p>

<p>Our buildings were never designed to satisfy an airborne pandemic. Our rooms are too small, HVAC systems too weak, circulation corridors too narrow. Amidst the cloud of Covid-19, how might we create temporary spaces for socially-distanced gathering? </p>

<h2>We need each other’s company, perhaps now more than ever. </h2>

<p>Design Criteria:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Safe</strong>: Fire Code &amp; Building Code compliant </li>
	<li><strong>Cheap</strong> - both in initial cost and run costs</li>
	<li><strong>Fast</strong> - quick set-up and takedown</li>
	<li><strong>Minimally wasteful</strong> - consideration of waste and re-use are essential</li>
	<li><strong>Flexible</strong> - we’re piloting a space without a use, any successful design must accommodate needs as they emerge</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="code-highlighted code-html">What follows is an inquiry into an approximately 40’ by 40’ shelter that could accommodate approximately 16 - 24 individuals spaced more than 6’ apart.  </code></pre>

<p>The two most inexpensive and available pop-up shelters are tents and scaffolding. </p>

<p>What happens there?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Reservable space for in-person meetings</li>
	<li>School Field trips</li>
</ul>

<p>Technical concerns</p>

<ul>
	<li>Commercial extension cords and power strips zip-tied to scaffolding.</li>
	<li>Low Cost, fixed microphone PA System (lend-able asset)</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>

<p>Special Events</p>

<ul>
	<li>Corporate all-hands meetings for announcements</li>
	<li>Children’s programming </li>
</ul>

<p>Aspirational Programming</p>

<p>Haircuts</p>

<p>Pandemic Dentistry</p>

<h2>Tents</h2>

<p>Tent rental companies are in the “events” business, they provide super easy pop-up event spaces that are ready to be occupied. Rental companies general don’t have that many tents, and to keep one around for more than a few days is expensive. </p>

<h2>Scaffolding</h2>

<p>While the learning curve is steeper and solutions less turn-key, scaffolding meets the criteria in a more affordable and flexible format. One still must find a third party can handle roofing and weights/staking, which is tricky but manageable.</p>

<p>Power - commercial extension cords or even conduit terminating in outlets or power cords is an easy solution/ </p>

<p>Cabling may be run overhead along the braced scaffolding, and follow verticals down to a readily accessible location for all occupants.</p>

<p>Mounting</p>

<p>Spacing</p>

<p>This is something between a proposal, a provocation and notes. Some research. A work in progress, on all accounts,<br/></p>

<h2>Tents</h2>

<p>There is a long history of temporary structures created with scaffolding that are designed for public engagement. It is important to note, this design eschews any other elevation gain or other design.</p>

<p>So here is still deep value in social contact and collaboration in physical space. </p>

<p>It’s the end of August, 2020, and I’m an inhabitant of the small city of Cambridge, MA. Relatively speaking, Cambridge is a wealthy city, big tech and big pharma have settled into Kendall Square, adjacent to MIT.<br/></p>

<p>This illuminating article by Gina Bellafonte from the New York Times last month puts this all into perspective. </p>

<p>What follows is research conducted in the Cambridge, MA.<br/></p>

<p>As Sherry Turkle points out in “CONVERSATINO”, as humans there is no higher-bandwidth of communication than in-person conversation. Masks diminish the legibility of the human face, but…</p>

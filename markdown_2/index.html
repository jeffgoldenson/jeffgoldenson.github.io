<h1>Faux-mencement</h1>

<p>When we came together Wednesday, March 11th, 9:15 for final salon before Spring Break, everything was different. </p>

<h2>Everyone at the Table</h2>

<p>Welcome to the Greenhouse🌱. We’re a mostly no-credit, non-departmental creative salon inside Olin College. We grow young ideas, not plants. We Greenhouse-folk are a crosscutting bunch - staff, faculty and students alike. At best we come together as a production company. We produce culture that builds our community. </p>

<p><strong>ILLUSTRATION </strong></p>

<p>Plan view, Greenhouse, Robert Wechsler (Artist in Residence), Susan Mihailidis (Director of Academic Affairs), Jeff Goldenson (Senior Lecturer), Matt Brucker ‘20, Evan New-Schmidt ‘20, Ana Krishnan ‘20, Sam Kaplan ‘20. </p>

<ul>
	<li>You never know who’s gonna have the best idea. Don’t assume it’ll come from the folks regularly invited to the decision-making table</li>
	<li>When representatives from all corners of the college are around the table when a nascent notion emerges, everything evolves faster</li>
</ul>

<h2>Half Empty &gt; Half Full</h2>

<p>For the few folks that came to the Greenhouse that morning, it was a time to be angry, frustrated and sad. Emotions ran high, they deserved airtime &amp; space.</p>

	<li>Susan started us off - A time Capsule!</li>
	<li>From which we learned a hole for a sauna was dug over the weekend when students rented a small digger as a birthday present for a friend - </li>

<p>Evan had an idea: 💥“Fake Commencement”💥</p>

<h2>Pitch the Provost</h2>

<ul>
	<li>“Where’s Mark?”</li>
</ul>

<p>Susan - “I saw him working in the DH (dining hall)”</p>

<ul>
	<li>“Ana, you pitch it.”</li>
</ul>

<h1>Faux-mencement</h1>

<pre><code>&gt; A Team of Staff, Students &amp; Faculty around the table
&gt; Regularly making time to share ill-throught through notions, young ideas, and sometimes co-creating some magic✨ one. 
&gt; Leadership to pitch to</code></pre>

<p>When we came together Wednesday, March 11th, 9:15 for final salon before Spring Break, everything was different. </p>

<h2>Everyone at the Table</h2>

<p>Welcome to the Greenhouse🌱. </p>

<p>We’re a mostly no-credit, non-departmental creative salon inside Olin College. We grow young ideas, not plants. </p>

<p>We’re a crosscutting bunch - staff, faculty and students alike - sitting around a table making time for 🧠 storming together. At best we come together as a production company. We produce culture that builds our community. </p>

<p>Plan view, Greenhouse, Robert Wechsler (Artist in Residence), Susan Mihailidis (Director of Academic Affairs), Jeff Goldenson (Senior Lecturer), Matt Brucker ‘20, Evan New-Schmidt ‘20, Ana Krishnan ‘20, Sam Kaplan ‘20. </p>

<ul>
	<li>You never know who’s gonna have the best idea. Don’t assume it’ll come from the folks regularly invited to the decision-making table</li>
	<li>When representatives from all corners of the college are around the table when a nascent notion emerges, everything evolves faster</li>
</ul>

<h2>Half Empty &gt; Half Full</h2>

<p>For the few folks that came to the Greenhouse that morning, it was a time to be angry, frustrated and sad. Emotions ran high, they deserved airtime &amp; space.</p>

	<li>Susan started us off - A time Capsule!</li>

<p>Evan had an idea: 💥“Fake Commencement”💥</p>

<h2>Pitch the Provost</h2>

<ul>
	<li>“Where’s Mark?”</li>
</ul>

<p>Susan - “I saw him working in the DH (dining hall)”</p>

<ul>
	<li>“Ana, you pitch it.”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Posters are Important</h2>

<p>Everything we do, has to have some style. The inverse of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out">Gargage in, Garbage Out</a>. Matt Brucker jumped on the “campaign rollout”. How were we gonna get the word out in style? </p>

<p>An idea emerged. At Olin, the networked printers have the ability to email scans/copies to folks. Apparently, students had taken to scanning hand-written notes on printers and having those printers email “all-students@olin.edu”. Anonymity via email isn’t easy, this was a clever workaround folks had figured out lately. </p>

<p>Buy-in from students is very different, and a lot harder, than Faculty or Staff. integrity of the student communication channel is.</p>

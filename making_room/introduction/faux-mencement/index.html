<h1>How to “Graduate” in 26 Hours</h1>

<p>When we came together Wednesday, March 11th, 9:15 for final get together before Spring Break, everything was different. </p>

<p>Not long after, this note went to “Carpe” one of the pillars of Olin email list life.</p>

<h2>Everyone at the table</h2>

<p>Welcome to the Greenhouse🌱. </p>

<p>We’re a mostly no-credit, non-departmental creative studio inside <a href="http://www.olin.edu/">Olin College</a>. We grow young ideas, not plants. </p>

<p>We’re a crosscutting team - staff, faculty and students alike - sitting around a table making time for 🧠storming together. We’re present for each other as people. And sometimes the personal connections across barriers and roles that only shared failure can cement, magic happens in the round. </p>

<p>For the few folks that came to the Greenhouse that morning, it was a time to be angry, frustrated and sad. Emotions ran high, the feelings deserved airtime &amp; space.</p>

<h2>…but what could we do?</h2>

<p>After some time venting, we rallied. What could we do? Life gave us 🍋s, couldn’t we engineer some lemonade? </p>

	<li>Susan started us off - a time capsule!</li>
	<li>From which we learned a hole for a sauna was already dug over the weekend when students rented a small digger as a birthday present for a friend. Perfect…

<h3>Evan proposing: 💥“Fake Commencement”💥</h3>

<h1>Go Time</h1>

<h2>Pitch It</h2>

<pre><code>Jeff : “Where’s Mark?” (Interim Provost, Dean of Faculty)
Susan: “I saw him working in the DH (dining hall)”
Everyone : “Ana, you pitch it.”</code></pre>

<h2>Promote It</h2>

<p>Everything we do, has to have some style. The inverse of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out">Gargage in, Garbage Out</a>. Matt Brucker jumped on the “campaign rollout”. How were we gonna get the word out in style? </p>

<p>An idea emerged. At Olin, the networked printers have the ability to email scans/copies to folks. Apparently, students had taken to scanning hand-written notes on printers and having those printers email “all-students@olin.edu”. Anonymity via email isn’t easy, this was a clever workaround folks had figured out lately. </p>

<p>Buy-in from students is very different, and a lot harder, than Faculty or Staff. Integrity of the student communication channel/campaign is critical and their’s alone to handle.</p>

<h2>Make it</h2>

<p>This was a Lo-fi, all hands operation. </p>

<p>Mortar boards were folded en-masse that night at SLAC (Stay Late and Create) in the Library.</p>

<p>But Faux-mencement was real, down to the diplomas. Matt designed the “Diplomas” in MS-word in about 15 minutes, handed it off to Susan. Susan sent it along to Registrars’ Office, where Vivian ran a “mail merge” to sync graduate names with (almost earned) degrees. This was the traditional non-corona process, carrying the imprimatur of our Registrar, Linda - except it read “☻ congratulætions Olin student💥…”</p>

<h2>How Colleges Learn</h2>

<p>In 1994 Stewart Brand published an eye-opening book, “<em>How Buildings Learn,” </em>that explores how people shape buildings through time. I wish he’d write a follow-up called “How Colleges Learn” where he&#39;d capture college as a similarly dynamic medium and suggest strategies for institutional growth and change.</p>

<p>Until that happens, you can play a game of “find/replace” to get a preview. Swap the word “college” for “building” and large swaths of the book hold up surprisingly well. Here’s a nice articulation of the problem from the intro:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Almost no <del>buildings</del> <em>colleges</em> adapt well. They’re designed not to adapt; also budgeted and financed not to, constructed not to, maintained not to, regulated and taxed not to, even remodeled not to. But all <del>buildings</del> <em>college</em> (except monuments) adapt anyway, however poorly, because the usages in and around them are changing constantly.</p>

<p>Stewart Brand, How Buildings Learn</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Founded in 1997 with almost $500m, <em>Olin College of Engineering</em> in Needham MA was established to create a hands-on, “do-learn” education for a new kind of engineer. The ideas behind the creation of Olin and its commitment to student co-creation were radical. But structurally -- administratively, organizationally -- Olin looks and feels like most colleges. </p>

<p>How might a college make a structural commitment to learning? What would it look like? What might happen?</p>

<h2>Faux-mencement</h2>

<p>On Tuesday March 10th at 4:06pm a long email titled “Olin COVID-19 Important Updates” came into the inbox of every staff, student and faculty member at Olin College of Engineering. It came from Olin’s founding President, Rick Miller, informing the community that “...students should not plan to return to campus after spring break.” </p>

<p>About an hour later, at 5:27pm that same day, a brief message came across a very different channel, carpediem@olin.edu —Olin’s student-owned mailing list for last-minute, serendipitous opportunities. This one titled “Group Scream on the great lawn 5:40 EOM”. (EOM = End of Message)</p>

<p>As you walk into our only academic building the first room you’ll find is the Greenhouse, a small creative studio where we grow young ideas, and some plants. When we gathered around the table the next morning nothing was normal. Joining me were: Susan Mihailidis, Director of Academic Affairs and Sponsored Programs, Robert Wechsler, Olin’s Artist in Residence, Matt Brucker ‘20, Ana Krishnan ‘20, Evan New-Schmidt ‘20 and Sam Kaplan ‘24. For these few students who made it out of bed, emotions ran high. The feelings deserved airtime and the best thing we could do as staff in the Greenhouse was to honor them by listening. </p>

<p>After about an hour a heaviness set in and Susan, a senior member of the administration with the respect of everyone across the college, was ready to act. “How about a time capsule?” she challenged. As the idea bounced around the energy shifted. That’s when Evan ‘20 chimed in, “how about a fake commencement?” Those five words sucked the air out of the room. </p>

<p>Within minutes, and with giddy purpose, we strode over to the Campus Center to pitch the provost. The Campus Center houses Olin’s only dining hall, which most mornings doubles as the Interim-Provost’s office. In the far side of the room, back to the wall, sat Mark Somerville, reliably in his black turtleneck. Ana ‘20 took the lead and pitched the idea as the rest of us looked on. Mark’s reply, “What can I do to help?” gave us the green light to get moving. </p>

<p>Walking back to the Greenhouse, Matt ‘20, who not an hour before was rightly consumed by the shock of a senior spring evaporating, turned with a vigorous grin and a shrug of disbelief, “we’ve got something to do!” </p>

<p>From that moment a spirit of co-creation consumed the campus. Faux-mencement was a community-owned affair. Matt and Ana sent out a pitch-perfect Commencement Announcement that looked a little like a ransom note. Olin hadn’t rented the caps and gowns yet, so someone found an origami mortar board “how-to” and a decision was made for garbage bag gowns. Diplomas that read “☻ congratulætions Olin student💥…” were sent along to the Registrars’ Office so names could be matched with almost-earned degrees. After checking and re-checking for accuracy, the faux-diplomas earned the imprimatur of our Registrar Linda Canavan and Adam Novotny ‘21 rubber stamped ‘em with a freshly laser cut “GO Olin!” stamp. </p>

<p>Late that night at Stay Late and Create (SLAC), Olin’s weekly festival of creativity students folded origami mortar boards and trimmed trashbag gowns. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, other students collaborated with IT to set up a live-stream for families at home and commencement speakers - President, Provost, honored faculty, staff and students - who thought they had three months to write remarks, worked overtime. </p>

<p>As for Faux-mencement itself, the presence of all who attended was palpable. Emotions were as raw as they were joyful. The Olin Conductorless Orchestra played video game themes as leadership marched down the aisle. Somewhere in the mimidst the pump hand sanitizer ceremoniously applied at the podium while passing out diplomas to the moving of homemade yarn tassels to one side of an origami cap, the spirit of the rite of passage was vivid. </p>

<p>Faux-mencement matters because it was a pure expression of “Olin-ness” at the very moment we needed it most. On the eve of exile we came together to co-create the ritual of closure we could’ve lost. We did something. We took commencement back for ourselves and left Olin with a story. </p>

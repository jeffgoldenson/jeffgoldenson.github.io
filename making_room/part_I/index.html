<h2>How Colleges Learn</h2>

<p>In 1994 Stewart Brand published an eye-opening book, “<em>How Buildings Learn,” </em>that explores how people shape buildings through time. I wish he’d write a follow-up called “How Colleges Learn” where he&#39;d capture college as a similarly dynamic medium and suggest strategies for institutional growth and change.</p>

<p>Until that happens, you can play a game of “find/replace” to get a preview. Swap the word “college” for “building” and large swaths of the book hold up surprisingly well. Here’s a nice articulation of the problem from the intro:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Almost no <del>buildings</del> <em>colleges</em> adapt well. They’re designed not to adapt; also budgeted and financed not to, constructed not to, maintained not to, regulated and taxed not to, even remodeled not to. But all <del>buildings</del> <em>college</em> (except monuments) adapt anyway, however poorly, because the usages in and around them are changing constantly.</p>

<p>Stewart Brand, How Buildings Learn</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Founded in 1997 with almost $500m, <em>Olin College of Engineering</em> in Needham MA was established to create a hands-on, “do-learn” education for a new kind of engineer. The ideas behind the creation of Olin and its commitment to student co-creation were radical. But structurally -- administratively, organizationally -- Olin looks and feels like most colleges. </p>

<p>How might a college make a structural commitment to learning? What would it look like? What might happen?</p>

<h2>Faux-mencement</h2>

<p>On Tuesday March 10th at 4:06pm a long email titled “Olin COVID-19 Important Updates” came into the inbox of every staff, student and faculty member at Olin College of Engineering. It came from Olin’s founding President, Rick Miller, informing the community that “...students should not plan to return to campus after spring break.” </p>

<figure><img src="covid-19-2.jpg"/></figure>

<p>About an hour later, at 5:27pm that same day, a brief message came across a very different channel, carpediem@olin.edu —Olin’s student-owned mailing list for last-minute, serendipitous opportunities. This one titled “Group Scream on the great lawn 5:40 EOM”. (EOM = End of Message)</p>

<p>As you walk into our only academic building the first room you’ll find is the Greenhouse, a small creative studio where we grow young ideas, and some plants. When we gathered around the table the next morning nothing was normal. Joining me were: Susan Mihailidis, Director of Academic Affairs and Sponsored Programs, Robert Wechsler, Olin’s Artist in Residence, Matt Brucker ‘20, Ana Krishnan ‘20, Evan New-Schmidt ‘20 and Sam Kaplan ‘24. For these few students who made it out of bed, emotions ran high. The feelings deserved airtime and the best thing we could do as staff in the Greenhouse was to honor them by listening. </p>

<figure><img src="halfempty-halffull.png"/></figure>

<p>After about an hour a heaviness set in and Susan, a senior member of the administration with the respect of everyone across the college, was ready to act. “How about a time capsule?” she challenged. As the idea bounced around the energy shifted. That’s when Evan ‘20 chimed in, “how about a fake commencement?” Those five words sucked the air out of the room. </p>

<p>Within minutes, and with giddy purpose, we strode over to the Campus Center to pitch the provost. The Campus Center houses Olin’s only dining hall, which most mornings doubles as the Interim-Provost’s office. In the far side of the room, back to the wall, sat Mark Somerville, reliably in his black turtleneck. Ana ‘20 took the lead and pitched the idea as the rest of us looked on. Mark’s reply, “What can I do to help?” gave us the green light to get moving. </p>

<p>Walking back to the Greenhouse, Matt ‘20, who not an hour before was rightly consumed by the shock of a senior spring evaporating, turned with a vigorous grin and a shrug of disbelief, “we’ve got something to do!” </p>

<p>From that moment a spirit of co-creation consumed the campus. Faux-mencement was a community-owned affair. Matt and Ana sent out a pitch-perfect Commencement Announcement that looked a little like a ransom note. Olin hadn’t rented the caps and gowns yet, so someone found an origami mortar board “how-to” and a decision was made for garbage bag gowns. Diplomas that read “☻ congratulætions Olin student💥…” were sent along to the Registrars’ Office so names could be matched with almost-earned degrees. After checking and re-checking for accuracy, the faux-diplomas earned the imprimatur of our Registrar Linda Canavan and Adam Novotny ‘21 rubber stamped ‘em with a freshly laser cut “GO Olin!” stamp. </p>

<p>Late that night at Stay Late and Create (SLAC), Olin’s weekly festival of creativity students folded origami mortar boards and trimmed trashbag gowns. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, other students collaborated with IT to set up a live-stream for families at home and commencement speakers - President, Provost, honored faculty, staff and students - who thought they had three months to write remarks, worked overtime. </p>

<p>As for Faux-mencement itself, the presence of all who attended was palpable. Emotions were as raw as they were joyful. The Olin Conductorless Orchestra played video game themes as leadership marched down the aisle. Somewhere in the mimidst the pump hand sanitizer ceremoniously applied at the podium while passing out diplomas to the moving of homemade yarn tassels to one side of an origami cap, the spirit of the rite of passage was vivid. </p>

<p>Faux-mencement matters because it was a pure expression of “Olin-ness” at the very moment we needed it most. On the eve of exile we came together to co-create the ritual of closure we could’ve lost. We did something. We took commencement back for ourselves and left Olin with a story. </p>

<h2>Making Room for Community</h2>

<p>The Olin College Library sits at the front door of the college. As you walk into the Atrium of Milas Hall, to your left is admissions and just to your right are the glass doors of the Library propped open during the day with student-made hexagonal planters. Passing through the doors, reclaimed wood tables of interesting books greet you.</p>

<p>The books are lit by the curved bank of double-height windows lining the western wall. A bit further in you realize the floor plate has been cut away, revealing the lower level beneath. It is perhaps the most beautiful space on campus. </p>

<p>But the library was a ghost town. Only a handful of students would use it for quiet study and the only thing flying off the shelves was our collection of power drills. While deflating, it was understandable. In the typical Oliner’s model of the universe, research looks like iterating on a prototype with your project team, not quietly sitting in the stacks following footnotes.</p>

<p>This was the scene when I came to Olin as Library Director in 2014. Aaron Hoover, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering, was on the hiring committee and we hit it off immediately. Just a few weeks after arriving, with the backing of Olin’s leadership, Aaron and I set off on a campaign to invigorate the Library. We called it OWL, Olin Workshop on the Library. Our pitch to the students was simple: Aaron and I had been tasked with re-inventing the Library. Every one of us is at Olin because we believe in project based learning. Now it’s for real, the Library is our project, wanna help? </p>

<p>That first semester we began by inviting students to the Library for weekly lunchtime discussions. Early on we decided we should get some data. The students created an open-ended form and interviewed peers in the Dining Hall. A strong signal came back: “A Room of Requirement” was requested in multiple independent interviews. I was in the dark so I had to ask. According to the Harry Potter Lexicon, the Room of Requirement is “a magical room which can only be discovered by someone who is in need.” If you have a need, the room satisfies. </p>

<p>The whole exercise was a bit circular. We asked students what they needed from the library and they told us they needed a room to satisfy their needs. The students had spoken so we listened.</p>

<figure><img src="workroom-cleanup.jpg"/></figure>

<p>There was a large room at the back of the lower level of the library with no natural light. This was the “Storage Room,” approximately 700 square feet of space off limits to students. Up to that point, the OWL meetings had been a lot of talk. The prospect of clearing out the Storage Room was action. They brought a bunch of friends and with a little archival guidance from the Library team and disposal guidance from facilities we had our Room of Requirement within a week or two. </p>

<h3>The Room of Requirement (The Workroom)</h3>

<p><div class="juxtapose-responsive"> <iframe frameborder="0" class="juxtapose" width="800" height="573" src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=82cd6878-a5fb-11ea-a7cb-0edaf8f81e27"></iframe></div></p>

<p>Word of the room spread quickly and then-senior Chris Lee ‘15 came by the Library. Chris ran a student organization called Stay Late and Code (SLAC). They wanted to welcome more forms of creativity so SLAC was becoming Stay Late and Create. To kick off the new identity they wanted a new venue. </p>

<p>The problem was SLAC meets “8 - late” Wednesday nights when no Library staff are around. So Chris and I had a discussion about safety and expectations, he promised they’d clean up after themselves and I promised to buy the coolest vacuum available.</p>

<figure><img src="vacuum.jpg"/></figure>

<p>It didn’t take long for SLAC to become a fixture of Olin culture and five years in it’s as strong as ever. If you’re a Faculty member kicking off a new initiative - head to SLAC. If you want to co-work with friends while enjoying a few free snacks and some music - head to SLAC. The only requirement for a successful Room of Requirement is a willingness to give students the benefit of the doubt and say yes. </p>

<h2>Bagels &amp; Bookshelves</h2>

<figure><img src="retreat-invite-small.jpg"/></figure>

<p>“<em>Making Space for Making Culture</em>,” The Winter 2015 Faculty Retreat was devoted to the future of the library. The retreat provided the perfect platform for us to listen and learn from the Faculty. Three things came through loud and clear:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Community</strong> — people wanted a cross-roads that facilitated more staff, faculty and student interaction.</li>
	<li><strong>Flexibility</strong> — we needed to employ Olin’s commitment to prototyping and iteration in our pursuit of the Library. We needed maximum flexibility to try things.</li>
	<li><strong>Action</strong> — There was an energy in the room that day, a chance to try something new at the College. We needed to act fast to keep that energy alive.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first floor of the Library was spacious but inflexible. Strung together in long rows in the center of the space, the bookshelves consumed the main floor. Inspired by the retreat, we wanted to let the community “borrow” the room to host an event, and then reset the space, returning it to a functional library. So we put everything on wheels. </p>

<figure><img src="casters-process.jpg"/></figure>

<p>In one afternoon, fueled by the best bagels and cream cheese money could buy, the students mounted swivel casters to the bottom of the bookshelves. It was a safe and scrappy retrofit. If you wanted to put a date on when a new culture of the Olin Library was born, that Friday, February 19th 2015, would be it. For a few hundred dollars in casters and hardware and a couple hundred more for hand-crafted Sea Salt Bagels with Honey Rosemary cream cheese, the community came together turning The Library into a verb. It was a story folks would tell. </p>

<p>That summer, emboldened by what we saw students could do in one day, we created OWL Summer Design/Build. For eight weeks we set seven students loose to create the library the community wanted. The Library was our sandbox. </p>

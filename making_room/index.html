              How Colleges Learn
            </span>
          </h2>

<p>In 1994 Stewart Brand published an eye-opening book, <em>How Buildings Learn</em>, that explores how people shape buildings through time. I wish he’d write a follow-up called How Colleges Learn to capture college as a similarly dynamic medium ripe for reframing.</p>

<p>Until that happens, you can play a game of “find/replace” to get a preview.  Swap the word “college” for “building” and large swaths of the book hold up surprisingly well. Here’s a nice articulation of the problem from the intro:</p>

<blockquote class="athelas f4 ml0 mt0 pl4">
    <p>Almost no <del>buildings</del> <em>colleges</em> adapt well. They’re designed not to adapt; also budgeted and financed not to, constructed not to, maintained not to, regulated and taxed not to, even remodeled not to. But all <del>buildings</del> <em>colleges</em> (except monuments) adapt anyway, however poorly, because the usages in and around them are changing constantly. [pg.2]
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Colleges are facing enormous pressures to adapt -- from financial viability, to eroding public trust to equitable access. And Olin College of Engineering, the small project-based engineering college where I’m writing from, is no different. So how might a college reframe its world view to adapt to this new climate? In <em>How Buildings Learn</em>, Brand asks the question differently.</p>

<blockquote class="athelas f4 ml0 mt0 pl4">
      <p>What would a <del>building</del> <em>college</em> look like and act like if it was designed for easy servicing by the users themselves? Once people are comfortable doing their own maintenance and repair, reshaping comes naturally because they have the hands-on relationship with their space, and they know how it actually works and will have ideas about how to improve it. [pg. 189]</p>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Olin’s curriculum has been designed for easy servicing by faculty and students alike. And consequently, reshaping the curriculum has come naturally. But what about adapting our antiquated hierarchies and power dynamics? How might students, staff and faculty maintain, repair and reshape college culture? Compared to curricular adaptation, a college’s operational and organizational adaptation is an undiscovered country ripe for exploration. But where in a college would anyone go to do that work?</p>

<p>At Olin, you’d go to the Greenhouse. The Greenhouse is a different kind of college affordance -- neither a department, center or traditional greenhouse -- but a community of staff, students and faculty from all corners of the college committed to maintaining, repairing and reshaping Olin College. We have our own prominently located studio space with lots of glass to work in public.  Open the door to the Greenhouse and you’ll find folks committed to reshaping college culture.  We meet Wednesday mornings during Faculty Meeting (catching faculty and leadership on the way to and from). We share a table, a set of values and the belief that college has yet to reach its institutional potential. </p>

<p>Through these meetings coupled periodically producing community-wide experiences, we demonstrated to Olin how our community of staff, faculty and students could come together as people, outside our “lanes” and roles. In the process, we laid a foundation of trust necessary to collaborate at the college scale.  And for a few brief moments in the margins, Olin let the Greenhouse and the larger community have the run of the place. And that’s when the magic happens.</p>

<h2>Faux-mencement</h2>

<figure><img src="img/watching2.jpg" alt="Olin 3rd years Grace Montagnino, Abigail Fry, Anusha Datar, taking it all in.

<p>On Tuesday March 10th at 4:06pm a long email titled “Olin COVID-19 Important Updates” came into the inbox of every staff, student and faculty member at Olin College of Engineering. It came from Olin’s founding President, Rick Miller, informing the community that “...students should not plan to return to campus after spring break.” </p>

<figure><img src="img/covid-19-2.jpg"/></figure>

<p>About an hour later, at 5:27pm that same day, a brief message came across a very different channel, carpediem@olin.edu —Olin’s student-owned mailing list for last-minute, serendipitous opportunities. This one titled “Group Scream on the great lawn 5:40 EOM”. (EOM = End of Message)</p>

<p>By the time a few students and staff had gathered around a table the next morning, nothing was normal. We were in the Greenhouse, a small creative studio just inside the entrance to our only academic building. We grow young ideas, and some plants. Joining me were Susan Mihailidis, Director of Academic Affairs and Sponsored Programs; Robert Wechsler, Olin’s Artist in Residence; and a quartet of students: Matt Brucker ’20, Ana Krishnan ’20, Evan New-Schmidt ’20, and Sam Kaplan ’24. For these few students who had made it out of bed, emotions ran high. The feelings deserved airtime, and the best thing we could do as staff in the Greenhouse was to honor them by listening.</p>

<figure><img src="img/halfempty-halffull.png"/></figure>

<p>After about an hour, a heaviness set in and Susan, a senior member of the administration with the respect of everyone across the college, was ready to act. “How about a time capsule?” she challenged. As the idea bounced around the energy shifted. That’s when Evan ‘20 chimed in: “How about a fake commencement?”  Those five words sucked the air out of the room. </p>

<p>Within minutes, and with giddy purpose, we strode over to the Campus Center to pitch the idea to the Interim Provost and frequent collaborator, Mark Somerville.  The Campus Center houses Olin’s only dining hall, which most mornings doubles as Mark’s office. And there he was, on the far side of the room, back to the wall, reliably in his black turtleneck.  Ana ‘20 took the lead and pitched the idea as the rest of us looked on. Mark’s reply,  “What can I do to help?” gave us the green light to get moving.</p>

<p>Walking back to the Greenhouse, Matt ‘20, who not an hour before was rightly consumed by the shock of a senior spring evaporating, turned with a vigorous grin and a shrug of disbelief, “We’ve got something to <em>do!</em>”</p>

<p>From that moment a spirit of co-creation consumed the campus. Faux-mencement was a community-owned affair. Matt and Ana sent out a pitch-perfect Commencement Announcement that looked a little like a ransom note. Olin hadn’t rented the caps and gowns yet, so someone found an origami mortar board “how-to” and a decision was made for garbage bag gowns. Diplomas that read “☻ congratulætions Olin student💥…” were sent along to the Registrars’ Office so names could be matched with almost-earned degrees. After checking and re-checking for accuracy, the faux-diplomas earned the imprimatur of our Registrar Linda Canavan and Adam Novotny ‘21 rubber stamped ‘em with a freshly laser cut “GO Olin!” stamp. </p>

<figure><img src="img/diploma-flow2.png"/></figure>

<p>Late that night at Stay Late and Create (SLAC), Olin’s weekly festival of creativity students folded origami mortar boards and trimmed trashbag gowns.</p>

<p><div class="video-responsive"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/425710886?loop=1&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>

<p> Meanwhile, the commencement speakers - President, Provost, honored faculty, staff and students - who thought they had three months to write remarks, worked overtime.</p>

<p>As for the Faux-mencement itself, the sincerity was palpable. Emotions were as raw as they were joyful. The Olin Conductorless Orchestra played video game themes as leadership marched down the aisle. Somewhere between the candid remarks of the Senior Greeters, the ceremoniously applied hand sanitizer between handshakes and the ritual moving of hand-made yarn tassels across origami caps, the rite of passage was vivid. It was “the best commencement we’ve ever had,” according to Mark.</p>

<p>Faux-mencement matters because it was a pure expression of “Olin-ness” at the very moment we needed it most.  It was also a demonstration of our institutional agility and agency. On the eve of exile we came together to co-create the ritual of closure we could’ve lost. We took commencement back for ourselves, leaving Olin with a story. </p>

<h2>Demonstration</h2>

<p>In the Greenhouse we stage demonstrations, or “demos.” We don’t demo products, we demo culture. Greenhouse demos are explicitly designed human experiences in space to honor and reinforce a set of values and a way of being in college together as a community of participants.  Faux-mencement was a demo. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>What would a <del>building</del> <em>college</em> look like and act like if it was designed for easy servicing by the users themselves? [pg. 189]
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Faux-mencement, and the two other stories below, Build Week and Olin Workshop on the Library are candidate moments.  
</p>

<p>MARK CLIP</p>

<p>We stage our demos in the margins -- the less contested times outside the academic calendar and curriculum. Often the demos are a kind of “pop-up” re-programming of a familiar space with unfamiliarly convivial activity.  And while marginal, they’re high-leverage - for the brief time they’re happening they take center stage at Olin.</p>

<p>Ask an engineer what a demonstration is and she’ll tell you it’s “a practical exhibition and explanation of how something works.” Ask an activist, and she’ll describe “a public meeting or march protesting against something.” Greenhouse demos lie somewhere between. They exhibit the practical reality of how our community might occupy a familiar space committed to a set of values that promote repair and reshaping ourselves. To us that meant explicitly designing human experiences that embody generous hospitality, listening, and to leaving roles and titles at the door. </p>

<p>So how do you make an organic, compelling demonstration of culture? This is the Greenhouse process:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Invite Everyone to the Table</strong> 
      <br>early, often and without agenda</li>
  <li><strong>Find Room in the Margins</strong>
      <br>of the curriculum and the academic calendar</li>
  <li><strong>This is Show Business</strong> 
      <br>not “tell business,” we are designing experiences to be felt in the body</li>
</ol>

<p>Though compressed into 26 hours, Faux-mencement follows these steps. It began with students and staff around a table, drawing in the Interim Provost when we had a plan. It was staged on the lawn over lunch, in the margins of space and schedule. With homemade garb, diplomas, and a live-stream for the parents back home -- Faux-mencement was a show -- it was meaningful entertainment for us all. </p>

<p>How Colleges Learn documents three stories -- Faux-mencement, Build Week, and Olin Workshop on the Library -- to share both the process, but also the virtue and value for all constituents of doing this work at a college today.</p>


<h2>Build Week</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>The opposite of adaptation in <del>buildings</del> <em>colleges</em> is graceless turnover. The usual pattern is for a rapid succession of tenants, each scooping out all trace of the former tenants and leaving nothing that successors can use. [pg. 23]
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In early December 2019, just a few weeks before winter break, I was driving to Olin listening to National Public Radio.  Because Olin is an underwriter, occasionally their promotional messages are read by the radio hosts. Somewhere along I-90 that morning, as I listened to the Olin message being read, I realized it had changed. The new version announced Olin’s 20/20 celebration and it dawned on me how big a deal it was for the college.</p>

<p>January is a quiet moment in Olin’s academic calendar. Students are at home, the college is calm -- there’s room. Since Olin’s founding, the idea of doing an on campus January intersession experiment had been in the air but never happened. With Olin 20/20, we had an opening.</p>

<p>I went to the Greenhouse, made some coffee and made a pitch: let’s honor Olin 20/20 with a “back to our roots” January experiment in student, faculty and staff co-creation! Y’all want to do it?</p>

<p>The students were in and I stepped back. It’d be a heavy lift considering it was December 10th. The idea was to add seven days of “open space” to the calendar beginning January 15th. Fortunately the idea would be a win for the Advancement folks -- it was an audacious and authentic way to kick-off the <a href="http://www.olin.edu/olin-2020/">Olin 20/20</a> campaign. </p>

<p>A meeting was called in the Greenhouse and Olin’s leadership was excited. If students could demonstrate interest and commitment to executing all student-facing dimensions of the experience, there was a possibility. That week, while finishing up classes for the semester, the Greenhouse students took on the notion, called it “Build Week,” and made it their own. To convince administration, they drafted the <em>Build Week Constitution: A Case for Build Week:</em> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We’re approaching the year of Olin 2020, which calls for additional contemplation and planning for the future of Olin as a community and institution. Reflection during the semester schedule is encouraged and valuable, but the hectic nature of the semester doesn’t allow in-depth time for it. Olin Build Week is a time dedicated solely toward building community, reflection, and goals for the next 20 years of Olin. </p>

<p>THE BUILD WEEK CONSTITUTION</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a month that included the winter break, what began in the Greenhouse quickly became an Olin-wide idea that the students made a reality. Spaces filled up in a snap, and forty students returned to campus for a seven-day performance of institutional co-creation. What we found was that students were actually craving the opportunity to lend a hand. It was a way to manifest their feelings for the place. </p>

<p>MATT ON MAINTENANCE</p>

<h2>Maintenance</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>More is being spent on changing <del>buildings</del> <em>colleges</em> than on building new ones. [pg. 5]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Colleges are constantly performing maintenance. They spend a lot on it too. Large teams of folks manage the buildings, staying atop a never-ending backlog of repairs while fielding crises as they inevitably emerge. But what about culture and community maintenance -- true college maintenance?  Who takes care of that? </p>

<p>The Greenhouse saw this opportunity and made it our business.  We make the rounds to check in with folks. We called it “gardening.” We try to catch concerns or issues before they bubble-over. We’re a college resource to swiftly respond to the needs of culture and community, opportunities and crises alike.  Between us we have the access to organize immediate action. In the case of Faux-mencement, between us we can text the Interim Provost; the Registrar; the Facilities Manager; first years on up through seniors -- and expect immediate response.</p>

<p>Time and again, the most powerful things we did were the most hands-on.  Every project where we made room for students to renovate learning and departmental spaces has rewarded us with much more than just improving the physical plant:</p>

<ol>
  <li><span class="black i normal">Students appreciate the sense of ownership that comes with maintenance.</span></li>

<h2>Olin Workshop on the Library</h2>

<p>The Olin College Library sits at the front door of the college.  As you walk into the Atrium of Milas Hall, to your left is admissions and just to your right are the glass doors of the Library propped open during the day with student-made hexagonal planters. Passing through the doors, reclaimed wood tables of new and interesting books greet you, themselves lit by the curved bank of double-height windows lining  the western wall. A bit further in you realize the floor plate has been cut away, revealing the lower level beneath. It is perhaps the most beautiful space on campus.</p>


<h3>Across the Center</h3>

<p><div class="juxtapose-responsive"> <iframe frameborder="0" class="juxtapose" width="800" height="555" src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=f95a2288-a605-11ea-a7cb-0edaf8f81e27"></iframe> </div> </p>

<p>But when I came to Olin as Library Director in 2014, the library was a ghost town. Aaron Hoover, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering, was the faculty lead appointed to chart a new future for the library.  Aaron was on my hiring committee and fortunately we hit it off immediately. Just a few weeks after arriving, with the backing of Olin’s leadership, Aaron and I set off on a campaign to invigorate the Library. We called it OWL, Olin Workshop on the Library.   Our pitch to the students was simple: Every one of us is at Olin because we believe in project-based learning. Now it’s for real, reinventing the Library is our project, wanna help?</p>

<h3>Team Rooms</h3>

<p><div class="juxtapose-responsive"><iframe frameborder="0" class="juxtapose" width="800" height="581" src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=f2adf6a4-a5fa-11ea-a7cb-0edaf8f81e27"></iframe></div></p>

<p>That first semester we began by inviting students to the Library for weekly lunchtime discussions. At the outset, we gathered data.  The students created an open-ended form and interviewed peers in the Dining Hall. A strong signal came back: “A Room of Requirement” was requested in multiple independent interviews. I was in the dark so I had to ask.  According to the <a href="https://www.hp-lexicon.org/place/hogwarts-school-of-witchcraft-and-wizardry/hogwarts-seventh-floor/room-of-requirement/">Harry Potter Lexicon</a>, the Room of Requirement is “a magical room which can only be discovered by someone who is in need.” If you have a need, the room satisfies. What the students wanted was “open space” of their own.</p>



<p>There was a large room at the back of the lower level of the library with no natural light.  This was the “Storage Room,” approximately 700 square feet of space off limits to students. Up to that point, the  OWL meetings had been a lot of talk. The prospect of clearing out the Storage Room was action. The OWL students brought a bunch of friends and with a little archival guidance from the Library team and disposal guidance from facilities we had our Room of Requirement within a week or two.</p>

<h3>The Room of Requirement</h3>


<p><div class="juxtapose-responsive"> <iframe frameborder="0" class="juxtapose" width="800" height="573" src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=82cd6878-a5fb-11ea-a7cb-0edaf8f81e27"></iframe></div></p>

<p>Word of the room spread quickly and then-senior Chris Lee ‘15 came by the Library. Chris ran a student organization called Stay Late and Code (SLAC). They wanted to welcome more forms of creativity so SLAC was becoming Stay Late and Create. To kick off the new identity they wanted a new venue.</p>

<p>It didn’t take long for SLAC to become a fixture of Olin culture—and five years in, it’s as strong as ever. If you’re a Faculty member kicking off a new initiative - head to SLAC. If you’re a student looking to co-work with friends while enjoying a few free snacks and some music - head to SLAC.  The only requirement for a successful Room of Requirement was a willingness to give students the benefit of the doubt and say yes and to give the requirements a little time to come out of the woodwork.</p>

<figure><img src="img/vacuum-small.jpg" alt="This photo of the new vacuum, likely taken at SLAC (clock reads 10:30) was found on a Library memory card. "/><figcaption>This photo of the new vacuum, likely taken at SLAC (clock reads 10:30) was found on a Library memory card. </figcaption></figure>

<p>In January 2015, not long after that first SLAC, Aaron and I hosted the faculty retreat, “Making Space for Making Culture,” on the future of the library, this time to listen and learn from the Faculty.  Four themes came through loud and clear:</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="black"><strong>Community</strong> — people wanted a cross-roads that facilitated more staff, faculty and student interaction.</span></li>
  <li><span class="black"><strong>Flexibility</strong> — we needed to employ Olin’s commitment to prototyping and iteration in our pursuit of the Library. We needed maximum flexibility to try things.</span></li>
  <li><span class="black"><strong>Action</strong> — There was an energy in the room that day, a chance to try something new at the College. We needed to act fast to keep that energy alive.</span></li>
  <li><span class="black"><strong>Coffee</strong> — the word coffee came up with enormous frequency.</span></li>
</ul>


<p>The first floor of the Library was spacious but inflexible. Strung together in long rows in the center of the space, the bookshelves consumed the main floor. Inspired by the retreat, we wanted to let the community “borrow” the room to host an event, and then reset the space, returning it to a functional library. How might the main floor be its own room of requirement for the faculty and larger college community? By putting everything on wheels. 
</p>

<figure><img src="img/mobile-bookshelves-event.jpg"/></figure>

<p>In one afternoon, fueled by <a href="http://www.bagelsaurus.com/#ourstory">the best bagels and cream cheese money could buy</a>, the students mounted swivel casters to the bottom of the bookshelves. It was a safe and scrappy retrofit. If you wanted to put a date on when a new culture of the Olin Library was born, that Friday, February 19th 2015, would be it. The community came together turning The Library into a verb. </p>

<figure><img src="img/casters-process.jpg"/></figure>

<p>In the process, we hit on the summer’s formula:</p> 
<ol>
  <li><span class="black normal">Pitch students on making a dramatic change to a public space</span></li>
  <li><span class="black">Make it a party, encourage folks to play music, hang out and have fun</span></li>
  <li><span class="black">Spend hundreds feeding them memorable food</span></li>
  <li><span class="black">Save thousands by retrofitting existing resources with our own hands</span></li>
  <li><span class="black">Buy a nice camera (that students can borrow) to document everything</span></li>
  <li><span class="black">Review with Facilities beforehand to ensure safety and feasibility</span></li>
</ol>

<p>That summer, emboldened by what we saw students could do in one day, we created OWL Summer Design/Build. For eight weeks we set seven students free to create the library the community wanted. We played music, took a field trip, swam in Wellesley’s lake, brewed coffee and called it learning.</p>

<h2>This is Project Based Organizational Change</h2>

<p>When we claim maintaining and adapting the college as project-based learning we foreground the unique “do-learn” opportunities embedded in the practice. Olin’s engineering coursework revolves around teams making things. Organizational change, college change, focuses on teams making things <em>happen</em>. This work requires collaboration across all constituents, engaging the broadest spectrum of folks.</p>

<p>Introducing <em>anything</em> new amidst today’s health &amp; safety concerns, insurance policies, fire codes, shrinking budgets and competing agendas is hard work. It also makes for rich learning.</p>

<p><div class="video-responsive"> <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/421811623?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>

<p>If a team of students wants to work with staff and leadership to make something happen in college, they need to understand how college works.  They’re motivated to look behind the curtain. And there they see the college for what it is: a universe unto itself complete with its own issues and idiosyncrasies, people and politics. This is “do-learn” organizational change. To make any headway takes careful thinking and planning.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do we frame <em class="serif red">x</em>?</li>
  <li>How do we do <em class="serif red">x</em> with the resources at hand?</li>
  <li>Who should we talk to first?</li>
  <li>How do we satisfy students and administrators simultaneously?</li>
  <li>How might we measure success?</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s hard to teach this kind of thinking, this kind of hustle, inside the curriculum. Walk out of the classroom and into the halls of power and there’s a whole other universe of learning waiting. Making change at Olin is good practice for making change in the world. </p>




<h2>Beginning</h2>

<p>So where do you start? Perhaps you begin with a commitment to conversation across the community. Maybe it’d look like ACRONYM. </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Free Coffee &amp; Tea</strong></li>
  <li>Wednesday’s 12:30-2pm</li>
  <li>Milas Hall Atrium</li>
  <li>Fresh-brewed </li>
  <li>Served by Students</li>
</ul>

<p>ACRONYM is a pop-up cafe with all the details. A chalkboard, a playlist, mugs courtesy of the “play with clay” co-curricular. The coffee’s delicious and it takes forever - turns out pour-over coffee delivered by novice baristas is a slow, inefficient proposition. </p>

<p>And while at first the long lines seemed a bug, they quickly proved a feature. What folks don’t pay in money, they pay in time. Time spent in line chatting, listening, spacing out -- building community. Each Wednesday ACRONYM pops up, makes a convivial cafe, and is gone in three hours. But for those three hours once a week, our college is a different place. </p>

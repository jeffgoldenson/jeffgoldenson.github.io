              How Colleges Learn
            </span>
          </h2>

<p>In 1994 Stewart Brand published an eye-opening book, “<em>How Buildings Learn,” </em>that explores how people shape buildings through time. I wish he’d write a follow-up called “How Colleges Learn” where he&#39;d capture college as a similarly dynamic medium and suggest strategies for institutional growth and change.</p>

<p>Until that happens, you can play a game of “find/replace” to get a preview. Swap the word “college” for “building” and large swaths of the book hold up surprisingly well. Here’s a nice articulation of the problem from the intro:</p>

<blockquote class="athelas ml0 mt0 pl4 black-90 bl bw2 b--blue">
    <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">
<p>Almost no <del>buildings</del> <em>colleges</em> adapt well. They’re designed not to adapt; also budgeted and financed not to, constructed not to, maintained not to, regulated and taxed not to, even remodeled not to. But all <del>buildings</del> <em>colleges
'</em> (except monuments) adapt anyway, however poorly, because the usages in and around them are changing constantly.</p>

</p>
    <cite class="f6 ttu tracked fs-normal">―Stewart Brand</cite>

<p>Stewart Brand, How Buildings Learn</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Founded in 1997 with almost $500m, <em>Olin College of Engineering</em> in Needham MA was established to create a hands-on, “do-learn” education for a new kind of engineer. The ideas behind the creation of Olin and its commitment to student co-creation were radical. But structurally -- administratively, organizationally -- Olin looks and feels like most colleges. </p>

<p>How might a college make a structural commitment to learning? What would it look like? What might happen?</p>

<h2>Faux-mencement</h2>

<figure><img src="img/watching2.jpg" alt="Olin 3rd years Grace Montagnino, Abigail Fry, Anusha Datar, taking it all in.

<p>On Tuesday March 10th at 4:06pm a long email titled “Olin COVID-19 Important Updates” came into the inbox of every staff, student and faculty member at Olin College of Engineering. It came from Olin’s founding President, Rick Miller, informing the community that “...students should not plan to return to campus after spring break.” </p>

<figure><img src="img/covid-19-2.jpg"/></figure>

<p>About an hour later, at 5:27pm that same day, a brief message came across a very different channel, carpediem@olin.edu —Olin’s student-owned mailing list for last-minute, serendipitous opportunities. This one titled “Group Scream on the great lawn 5:40 EOM”. (EOM = End of Message)</p>

<p>As you walk into our only academic building the first room you’ll find is the Greenhouse, a small creative studio where we grow young ideas, and some plants. When we gathered around the table the next morning nothing was normal. Joining me were: Susan Mihailidis, Director of Academic Affairs and Sponsored Programs, Robert Wechsler, Olin’s Artist in Residence, Matt Brucker ‘20, Ana Krishnan ‘20, Evan New-Schmidt ‘20 and Sam Kaplan ‘24. For these few students who made it out of bed, emotions ran high. The feelings deserved airtime and the best thing we could do as staff in the Greenhouse was to honor them by listening. </p>

<figure><img src="img/halfempty-halffull.png"/></figure>

<p>After about an hour a heaviness set in and Susan, a senior member of the administration with the respect of everyone across the college, was ready to act. “How about a time capsule?” she challenged. As the idea bounced around the energy shifted. That’s when Evan ‘20 chimed in, “how about a fake commencement?” Those five words sucked the air out of the room. </p>

<p>Within minutes, and with giddy purpose, we strode over to the Campus Center to pitch the provost. The Campus Center houses Olin’s only dining hall, which most mornings doubles as the Interim-Provost’s office. In the far side of the room, back to the wall, sat Mark Somerville, reliably in his black turtleneck. Ana ‘20 took the lead and pitched the idea as the rest of us looked on. Mark’s reply, “What can I do to help?” gave us the green light to get moving. </p>

<p>Walking back to the Greenhouse, Matt ‘20, who not an hour before was rightly consumed by the shock of a senior spring evaporating, turned with a vigorous grin and a shrug of disbelief, “we’ve got something to do!” </p>

<p>From that moment a spirit of co-creation consumed the campus. Faux-mencement was a community-owned affair. Matt and Ana sent out a pitch-perfect Commencement Announcement that looked a little like a ransom note. Olin hadn’t rented the caps and gowns yet, so someone found an origami mortar board “how-to” and a decision was made for garbage bag gowns. Diplomas that read “☻ congratulætions Olin student💥…” were sent along to the Registrars’ Office so names could be matched with almost-earned degrees. After checking and re-checking for accuracy, the faux-diplomas earned the imprimatur of our Registrar Linda Canavan and Adam Novotny ‘21 rubber stamped ‘em with a freshly laser cut “GO Olin!” stamp. </p>

<figure><img src="img/diploma-flow2.png"/></figure>

<p>Late that night at Stay Late and Create (SLAC), Olin’s weekly festival of creativity students folded origami mortar boards and trimmed trashbag gowns. </p>

<p><div class="video-responsive"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/425710886?loop=1&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>

<p>Meanwhile, other students collaborated with IT to set up a live-stream for families at home and commencement speakers - President, Provost, honored faculty, staff and students - who thought they had three months to write remarks, worked overtime. </p>

<p>As for Faux-mencement itself, the presence of all who attended was palpable. Emotions were as raw as they were joyful. The Olin Conductorless Orchestra played video game themes as leadership marched down the aisle. Somewhere in the mimidst the pump hand sanitizer ceremoniously applied at the podium while passing out diplomas to the moving of homemade yarn tassels to one side of an origami cap, the spirit of the rite of passage was vivid. </p>

<p>Faux-mencement matters because it was a pure expression of “Olin-ness” at the very moment we needed it most. On the eve of exile we came together to co-create the ritual of closure we could’ve lost. We did something. We took commencement back for ourselves and left Olin with a story. </p>

<h2>Making Room for Community</h2>

<p>The Olin College Library sits at the front door of the college. As you walk into the Atrium of Milas Hall, to your left is admissions and just to your right are the glass doors of the Library propped open during the day with student-made hexagonal planters. Passing through the doors, reclaimed wood tables of interesting books greet you.</p>

<p>The books are lit by the curved bank of double-height windows lining the western wall. A bit further in you realize the floor plate has been cut away, revealing the lower level beneath. It is perhaps the most beautiful space on campus. </p>

<p>But the library was a ghost town. Only a handful of students would use it for quiet study and the only thing flying off the shelves was our collection of power drills. While deflating, it was understandable. In the typical Oliner’s model of the universe, research looks like iterating on a prototype with your project team, not quietly sitting in the stacks following footnotes.</p>

<p>This was the scene when I came to Olin as Library Director in 2014. Aaron Hoover, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering, was on the hiring committee and we hit it off immediately. Just a few weeks after arriving, with the backing of Olin’s leadership, Aaron and I set off on a campaign to invigorate the Library. We called it OWL, Olin Workshop on the Library. Our pitch to the students was simple: Aaron and I had been tasked with re-inventing the Library. Every one of us is at Olin because we believe in project based learning. Now it’s for real, the Library is our project, wanna help? </p>

<p>That first semester we began by inviting students to the Library for weekly lunchtime discussions. Early on we decided we should get some data. The students created an open-ended form and interviewed peers in the Dining Hall. A strong signal came back: “A Room of Requirement” was requested in multiple independent interviews. I was in the dark so I had to ask. According to the Harry Potter Lexicon, the Room of Requirement is “a magical room which can only be discovered by someone who is in need.” If you have a need, the room satisfies. </p>

<p>The whole exercise was a bit circular. We asked students what they needed from the library and they told us they needed a room to satisfy their needs. The students had spoken so we listened.</p>

<figure><img src="img/workroom-cleanup.jpg"/></figure>

<p>There was a large room at the back of the lower level of the library with no natural light. This was the “Storage Room,” approximately 700 square feet of space off limits to students. Up to that point, the OWL meetings had been a lot of talk. The prospect of clearing out the Storage Room was action. They brought a bunch of friends and with a little archival guidance from the Library team and disposal guidance from facilities we had our Room of Requirement within a week or two. </p>

<h3>The Room of Requirement (The Workroom)</h3>

<p><div class="juxtapose-responsive"> <iframe frameborder="0" class="juxtapose" width="800" height="573" src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=82cd6878-a5fb-11ea-a7cb-0edaf8f81e27"></iframe></div></p>

<p>Word of the room spread quickly and then-senior Chris Lee ‘15 came by the Library. Chris ran a student organization called Stay Late and Code (SLAC). They wanted to welcome more forms of creativity so SLAC was becoming Stay Late and Create. To kick off the new identity they wanted a new venue. </p>

<p>The problem was SLAC meets “8 - late” Wednesday nights when no Library staff are around. So Chris and I had a discussion about safety and expectations, he promised they’d clean up after themselves and I promised to buy the coolest vacuum available.</p>

<figure><img src="img/vacuum-small.jpg" alt="This photo of the new vacuum, likely taken at SLAC (clock reads 10:30) was found on a Library memory card. "/><figcaption>This photo of the new vacuum, likely taken at SLAC (clock reads 10:30) was found on a Library memory card. </figcaption></figure>

<p>It didn’t take long for SLAC to become a fixture of Olin culture and five years in it’s as strong as ever. If you’re a Faculty member kicking off a new initiative - head to SLAC. If you want to co-work with friends while enjoying a few free snacks and some music - head to SLAC. The only requirement for a successful Room of Requirement is a willingness to give students the benefit of the doubt and say yes. </p>

<h2>Bagels &amp; Bookshelves</h2>

<figure><img src="img/faculty-retreat.jpg"/></figure>

<p>“<em>Making Space for Making Culture</em>,” The Winter 2015 Faculty Retreat was devoted to the future of the library. The retreat provided the perfect platform for us to listen and learn from the Faculty. Three things came through loud and clear:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Community</strong> — people wanted a cross-roads that facilitated more staff, faculty and student interaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Flexibility</strong> — we needed to employ Olin’s commitment to prototyping and iteration in our pursuit of the Library. We needed maximum flexibility to try things.</li>
  <li><strong>Action</strong> — There was an energy in the room that day, a chance to try something new at the College. We needed to act fast to keep that energy alive.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first floor of the Library was spacious but inflexible. Strung together in long rows in the center of the space, the bookshelves consumed the main floor. Inspired by the retreat, we wanted to let the community “borrow” the room to host an event, and then reset the space, returning it to a functional library. So we put everything on wheels. </p>

<figure><img src="img/mobile-bookshelves-event.jpg"/></figure>

<p>In one afternoon, fueled by the best bagels and cream cheese money could buy, the students mounted swivel casters to the bottom of the bookshelves. It was a safe and scrappy retrofit. If you wanted to put a date on when a new culture of the Olin Library was born, that Friday, February 19th 2015, would be it. For a few hundred dollars in casters and hardware and a couple hundred more for hand-crafted Sea Salt Bagels with Honey Rosemary cream cheese, the community came together turning The Library into a verb. It was a story folks would tell. </p>

<figure><img src="img/casters-process.jpg"/></figure>

<p>That summer, emboldened by what we saw students could do in one day, we created OWL Summer Design/Build. For eight weeks we set seven students loose to create the library the community wanted. The Library was our sandbox. </p>

<p>Sometime after March 13th, 2020, when Olin students got home they did what a number of other college students did across the country. Oliners logged into Minecraft and collaboratively constructed iconic elements of the Olin campus in its blocky universe. Officially released in late 2011, Minecraft is a video game which has gone on to become the second best-selling video game of all time -- Tetris tops the list. Minecraft fits in a specific genre of video games, it’s what’s known as a “sandbox” game.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/132470/the_history_and_theory_of_sandbox_.php?print=1">The History and Theory of Sandbox Gameplay</a>, longtime game writer Steve Breslin elaborates, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sandbox genre grew out of the natural pleasure of designing game-worlds -- a pleasure that game developers experience all the time. </p>

<p>Steve Breslin, 2009 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Folks play sandbox games for many reasons, but they are not played to win. What made OWL, and particularly the Summer Design/Build program, magic was that it too was a sandbox game. The joy of OWL grew out of the natural pleasure of designing a real world, the Olin Library.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is interesting about the sandbox form is not that it allows full freedom, but that it generalizes and parameterizes, it finds arenas for agency and gently crafts the potential space of the game. It fosters a sense of free-play and exploration of that space. It engenders a sense of player control, without actually handing over the reins entirely. </p>

<p>Steve Breslin, 2009</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout that Summer we ran what we called “Friday Fundays.” Monday through Thursday, we would collaboratively pursue projects within a certain framework. Friday was different. We would begin the morning with some coffee, standing in the round, each sharing the marginally library-related notion we planned to explore. One Friday afternoon halfway through the Summer a deafening amount of clanging came up from the Lower Level of the Library. It went on for a few hours, uninterrupted. Aaron was off in the Machine Shop fabricating something in another building, and I closed my door and turned up the music. </p>

<p>“Fundays” would end with a modest show and tell near the front door of the Library. That day the students invited us down to see what they’d been working on. What we saw when we got downstairs was shocking. They had carved out a whole new “room” within the stacks by disassembling two 24’ long ranges of steel bookshelves. Aaron and I must have been visibly agitated - it was kinda upsetting. But once the students pointed out how they had responsibly condensed the books on the existing shelving, neatly stacking the leftover components into organized piles in the corner, things got better. </p>

<p>In a matter of hours, without permission, folks made what was likely the most transformative intervention of the Summer. We’d collaboratively agreed upon the rules of sandbox play, and the students followed them to a “T”. Adaption can feel a little upsetting at first. </p>

<p>In those first days of the Summer, the nine of us sat seminar style in the center of the Library while Aaron and I “generalized” and “parameterized” the opportunity. We began with a deep dive into the history, mission and power of libraries as a civic and collegiate institution. We then parameterized what famed game creator Will Wright calls the “Possibility Space.” We introduced students to the rudiments of fire code governing spaces of public assembly, we went through the modest budget we’d all be working from and we outlined our expectations. Finally, we established a code of co-creation: respectful, responsible, always reversible, mission-aligned hacking. And the next day we were off. </p>

<h3>Across the Center</h3>

<p>That said, sometimes bottom-up organic and action isn’t the right choice. Larger projects require planning. As Olin contemplated the renovation of its Academic Center, we set out on a semester-long, community-engaged planning process with Annie Barrett of Barrett Architecture Studio. That Fall a team of faculty, staff and students wrangled data and opinion from across the college. We assessed our needs and consolidated lessons learned. What we found resonated. </p>

<p><div class="video-responsive"> <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/406211427?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></p>

<h2>Happenings </h2>

<p>At the end of the summer we put a date in the calendar - a welcome back “Community Breakfast” in the Library the day before classes began. We purchased a huge amount of the Bagelsaurus sea salt bagels with honey rosemary cream cheese (becoming fast friends with the owner), a few bagel cutters, covered the tables in black kraft paper, made a playlist and had a joyful morning in The <em>New</em> Library.</p>

<figure><img src="img/breakfast-invite.jpg"/></figure>

<p>That Community Breakfast was a high-water mark for the Library. It was the end of an arc that began a year before. Quickly thereafter, courses were in full swing, available time shrank, and momentum risked fading. So we talked. Spiky engagements, chunks of time out of sync with academic deadlines was do-able, sustained engagements were much harder. Beginning at that week’s meeting, OWL shifted away from making things and began producing what we called “Happenings.” </p>

<p>“Happenings,” a term coined by artist Allan Kaprow in the late 1950’s, have their own history as an art and performance medium likely beginning in the Summer of 1952 at Black Mountain College. But to us they were time-bound, loosely choreographed, gatherings with multiple concurrent student-run activities. We scheduled them sufficiently in advance to welcome all of Olin. The “Holiday Happening” consisted of music, screenprinting, an “Awkward Family Photo Booth,” but the centerpiece was always the staff-organized cookie swap. It got big. We also welcomed the Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences Capstone projects, transforming the Library into a gallery of scattered exhibits, live music and a generous spread of homemade falafel, muhammara, Labneh with za’atar, baba ganoush and pita from the Armenian Markets a few towns over. </p>

<p>The Happenings began to have a feeling. We intentionally designed these experiences so we might all inhabit, for just a few hours, an Olin that lived by different values of our own design. What might a college committed to generous hospitality, listening, and to leaving roles and titles at the door feel like? Happenings iterated on our existing culture. At best, folks would show up, try on a different college experience, have a good time and head home. </p>

<p>By no recognizable institutional logic was spending hundreds dollars of a tight library budget on the finest bagels and armenian cuisine available, or stocking a huge inventory of photo paper and ink to give away for a single holiday gathering easily justifiable. It’s not what college libraries do. But why not? In a parallel universe with a different set of values, bringing 150-200 people from all corners of the college through the Library doors to eat, make, and celebrate student work was a bargain. We set the stage -- and the lights and the camera -- so students would walk out those same doors that evening holding an “awkward” family photo with their project team and their professors warming themselves by a cardboard fireplace. </p>

<p>Colleges need to create the conditions for students to make memories that bond the whole community. Why else work, or learn, at a college? </p>

<h2>Build Week</h2>

<p>In early December 2019, just a few weeks before winter break, I was driving to Olin listening to National Public Radio. Olin is an underwriter, occasionally their promotional messages are read by the radio hosts. Somewhere along I-90 that morning, as I listened to the Olin message being read, I realized it had changed. The new version announced Olin’s 20/20 celebration and it dawned on me how big a deal it was for the college. </p>

<p>January is a quiet moment in Olin’s academic calendar. Students are at home, the college is calm. Since Olin’s founding, the idea of doing an on campus January intersession experiment had been in the air, but it never happened. With Olin 20/20, we had an opening. </p>

<p>I was excited. I went to the Greenhouse, made some coffee, and made a pitch -- let’s honor Olin 20/20 with a “back to our roots” January experiment in student, faculty and staff co-creation! Y’all want to do it?</p>

<p>The students were in, and I stepped back. It’d be a heavy lift considering it was December 10th. The idea was to add seven days of “open space” to the calendar beginning January 15th. Fortunately the idea would be a win for the Advancement folks -- it was an audacious and authentic way to kick-off the <a href="http://www.olin.edu/olin-2020/">Olin 20/20</a> campaign. </p>

<p>Olin’s leadership was excited. If students could demonstrate interest and commitment to executing all student-facing dimensions of the experience, there was a possibility. That week, while finishing up classes for the semester, the Greenhouse students took on the notion, called it “Build Week,” and made it their own. To convince administration, they drafted the <em>Build Week Constitution: A Case for Build Week:</em> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We’re approaching the year of Olin 2020, which calls for additional contemplation and planning for the future of Olin as a community and institution. Reflection during the semester schedule is encouraged and valuable, but the hectic nature of the semester doesn’t allow in-depth time for it. Olin Build Week is a time dedicated solely toward building community, reflection, and goals for the next 20 years of Olin. </p>

<p>THE BUILD WEEK CONSTITUTION</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a month, which included the winter break, what began in the Greenhouse quickly became an Olin-wide idea that the students made a reality. Forty students returned to campus for seven days of institutional co-creation. And by the end, they got great stuff done. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Dorm kitchens were cleaned, lightly renovated and reorganized</li>
  <li>Artists painted a multi-canvas mural and mounted it in the Dining Hall</li>
  <li>Students and staff converted a large storage room into an inviting faculty research space </li>
  <li>Community-created visions for the future of the college presented</li>
  <li>And many other projects</li>
</ul>

<p>But the story wasn’t the project, it was planning and executing the undertaking itself. Led by four deeply committed students: Dieter ‘22, Riya ‘22, Sam ‘22 and Vicky ‘20, everyone collaborated to stand up a week of “college.” Olin was the stage for the college of their imagination. It was limited only by their imaginations and the realities of food, safety and responsibility -- a.k.a. reality. Yes, there was learning in making things, but the real learning was in the work of making things happen. They: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Wrote a Constitution</li>
  <li>Made a case to leadership</li>
  <li>Developed a Student Application Process</li>
  <li>Agreed on a Code of Conduct</li>
  <li>Developed a workflow for “Tent-Pole” Projects: Ideation &gt; Application &gt; Selection Process &gt; Realization</li>
  <li>Drafted The Daily Schedule </li>
  <li>Screen printed swag - t-shirts and posters galore! </li>
  <li>Created a menu for 40 (with multiple dietary concerns)</li>
  <li>Hosted a big culminating report out </li>
</ul>

<h2>A Department of Requirement</h2>

<p>In the heart of <em>“How Buildings Learn,”</em> there’s a chapter entitled “The Romance of Maintenance.” In it Brand celebrates preventative maintenance. Buildings learn when there’s an investment in their continual maintenance and growth. Colleges think a lot about building maintenance. Large teams of folks manage a never-ending backlog of repairs while fielding crises as they inevitably emerge. Sometimes they make repairs themselves, sometimes they contract out and project manage. But they take care of it. </p>

<p>What about culture and community maintenance -- college maintenance? Who fields the cultural opportunities and crises as they inevitably emerge?</p>

<p>The fun entry to the Greenhouse is to step through the display-window. Scanning the room you’ll see screen prints, a huge cutting mat, a Chemex coffeemaker, some ceramic mugs Robert (Olin’s Artist in Residence) and Mark (Interim Provost and Dean of Faculty) made, a cardboard bear, black kraft paper, white pens, plants in beakers, a homemade printer that uses giant markers as ink, student sketches, books and a stump. The hacked IKEA shelving that lines the walls brings a little order. In the middle sits the large steel frame table we gather around - a student-made artifact from the Design/Build Summer of 2015. </p>

<p>The Greenhouse is a community, a mix of staff, students and faculty who meet Wednesday mornings during Faculty Meeting. We make college by making culture in the margins. (We catch faculty and senior staff on their way to and from the meeting.) We share a table - that table - a set of values and a bias towards action. Build Week and Faux-mencement happened because all corners of the college had a regular meeting around that table to chat. </p>

<p>Remember the Library’s Room of Requirement? Think of the Greenhouse as Olin’s Department of Requirement. We do a different kind of college maintenance. We listen closely for institutional creaks and leaks, we make the rounds checking in with folks. We try to catch concerns or issues before they bubble-over. A Department of Requirement, whether it goes by Greenhouse or any other name, is organizational “open space” ready to swiftly and earnestly engage all constituents in maintenance, preventative maintenance or new construction. Crucially, the Department of Requirement is an agile <em>academic</em> department. It houses a rotating cast of faculty, a small staff and a committed team of students, learning. </p>

<h2>This is Project Based Organizational Change</h2>

<p>When we claim the creation of culture and community as project-based learning we foreground the unique “do-learn” opportunities embedded in the practice. Olin’s engineering coursework revolves around teams making things. Organizational change, college change, focuses on teams making things happen. This work requires collaboration across all corners of the college, engaging the broadest spectrum of folks.</p>

<p>Introducing <em>anything</em> new amidst today’s health &amp; safety concerns, insurance policies, fire codes, shrinking budgets and competing agendas is hard work. It also makes for rich learning. </p>

<p>If a team of students wants to work with staff and leadership to make a repair or make something happen in college, they need to understand how college works. They’re motivated to look behind the curtain. And there they see the college for what it is: a universe unto itself complete with its own issues and idiosyncrasies, people and politics. This is “do-learn” organizational change. To make any headway takes careful thinking and planning. </p>

<ul>
  <li>How do we frame “it”?</li>
  <li>How do we do it with the resources at hand?</li>
  <li>Who should we talk to first?</li>
  <li>Do we need a meeting? If so, what do we want to accomplish?</li>
  <li>How do we follow up? </li>
  <li>How do we satisfy students and administrators simultaneously? </li>
  <li>How might we measure success? </li>
</ul>

<p>It’s hard to teach this kind of thinking, this kind of hustle, inside the curriculum. Walk out of the classroom and into the halls of power and there’s a whole other universe of learning waiting. Making change at Olin is good practice for making change in the world. </p>

<h2>Beginning</h2>

<p>So where do you start? Perhaps you begin with a commitment to conversation across the community. Maybe it’d look like ACRONYM. </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Free Coffee &amp; Tea</strong></li>
  <li>Wednesday’s 12:30-2pm</li>
  <li>Milas Hall Atrium</li>
  <li>Fresh-brewed </li>
  <li>Served by Students</li>
</ul>

<p>ACRONYM is a pop-up cafe with all the details. A chalkboard, a playlist, mugs courtesy of the “play with clay” co-curricular. The coffee’s delicious and it takes forever - turns out pour-over coffee delivered by novice baristas is a slow, inefficient proposition. </p>

<p>And while at first the long lines seemed a bug, they quickly proved a feature. What folks don’t pay in money, they pay in time. Time spent in line chatting, listening, spacing out -- building community. Each Wednesday ACRONYM pops up, makes a convivial cafe, and is gone in three hours. But for those three hours once a week, our college is a different place. </p>

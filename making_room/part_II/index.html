<h2>Making Room for Community</h2>

<p>The Olin College Library sits at the front door of the college. As you walk into the Atrium of Milas Hall, to your left is admissions and just to your right are the glass doors of the Library propped open during the day with student-made hexagonal planters. Passing through the doors, reclaimed wood tables of interesting books greet you.</p>

<p>The books are lit by the curved bank of double-height windows lining the western wall. A bit further in you realize the floor plate has been cut away, revealing the lower level beneath. It is perhaps the most beautiful space on campus. </p>

<p>But the library was a ghost town. Only a handful of students would use it for quiet study and the only thing flying off the shelves was our collection of power drills. While deflating, it was understandable. In the typical Oliner’s model of the universe, research looks like iterating on a prototype with your project team, not quietly sitting in the stacks following footnotes.</p>

<p>This was the scene when I came to Olin as Library Director in 2014. Aaron Hoover, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering, was on the hiring committee and we hit it off immediately. Just a few weeks after arriving, with the backing of Olin’s leadership, Aaron and I set off on a campaign to invigorate the Library. We called it OWL, Olin Workshop on the Library. Our pitch to the students was simple: Aaron and I had been tasked with re-inventing the Library. Every one of us is at Olin because we believe in project based learning. Now it’s for real, the Library is our project, wanna help? </p>

<p>That first semester we began by inviting students to the Library for weekly lunchtime discussions. Early on we decided we should get some data. The students created an open-ended form and interviewed peers in the Dining Hall. A strong signal came back: “A Room of Requirement” was requested in multiple independent interviews. I was in the dark so I had to ask. According to the Harry Potter Lexicon, the Room of Requirement is “a magical room which can only be discovered by someone who is in need.” If you have a need, the room satisfies. </p>

<p>The whole exercise was a bit circular. We asked students what they needed from the library and they told us they needed a room to satisfy their needs. The students had spoken so we listened.</p>

<p>There was a large room at the back of the lower level of the library with no natural light. This was the “Storage Room,” approximately 700 square feet of space off limits to students. Up to that point, the OWL meetings had been a lot of talk. The prospect of clearing out the Storage Room was action. They brought a bunch of friends and with a little archival guidance from the Library team and disposal guidance from facilities we had our Room of Requirement within a week or two. </p>

<p>Word of the room spread quickly and then-senior Chris Lee ‘15 came by the Library. Chris ran a student organization called Stay Late and Code (SLAC). They wanted to welcome more forms of creativity so SLAC was becoming Stay Late and Create. To kick off the new identity they wanted a new venue. </p>

<p>The problem was SLAC meets “8 - late” Wednesday nights when no Library staff are around. So Chris and I had a discussion about safety and expectations, he promised they’d clean up after themselves and I promised to buy the coolest vacuum available.</p>

<p>It didn’t take long for SLAC to become a fixture of Olin culture and five years in it’s as strong as ever. If you’re a Faculty member kicking off a new initiative - head to SLAC. If you want to co-work with friends while enjoying a few free snacks and some music - head to SLAC. The only requirement for a successful Room of Requirement is a willingness to give students the benefit of the doubt and say yes. </p>

<h2>Bagels &amp; Bookshelves</h2>

<p>“<em>Making Space for Making Culture</em>,” The Winter 2015 Faculty Retreat was devoted to the future of the library. The retreat provided the perfect platform for us to listen and learn from the Faculty. Three things came through loud and clear:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Community</strong> — people wanted a cross-roads that facilitated more staff, faculty and student interaction.</li>
	<li><strong>Flexibility</strong> — we needed to employ Olin’s commitment to prototyping and iteration in our pursuit of the Library. We needed maximum flexibility to try things.</li>
	<li><strong>Action</strong> — There was an energy in the room that day, a chance to try something new at the College. We needed to act fast to keep that energy alive.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first floor of the Library was spacious but inflexible. Strung together in long rows in the center of the space, the bookshelves consumed the main floor. Inspired by the retreat, we wanted to let the community “borrow” the room to host an event, and then reset the space, returning it to a functional library. So we put everything on wheels. </p>

<p>In one afternoon, fueled by the best bagels and cream cheese money could buy, the students mounted swivel casters to the bottom of the bookshelves. It was a safe and scrappy retrofit. If you wanted to put a date on when a new culture of the Olin Library was born, that Friday, February 19th 2015, would be it. For a few hundred dollars in casters and hardware and a couple hundred more for hand-crafted Sea Salt Bagels with Honey Rosemary cream cheese, the community came together turning The Library into a verb. It was a story folks would tell. </p>

<p>That summer, emboldened by what we saw students could do in one day, we created OWL Summer Design/Build. For eight weeks we set seven students loose to create the library the community wanted. The Library was our sandbox. </p>

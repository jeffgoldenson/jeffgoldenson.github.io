<h1>Patterns</h1>

<h3>What’s an institution</h3>

<pre><code class="code-highlighted code-html">Institutions are the humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic and social interaction.

Throughout history, institutions have been devised by human beings to create order and reduce uncertainty in exchange.
					
_Institutions, Douglass C. North, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 1991_ </code></pre>

<p>Institutions don’t like Institutions don’t like risk, as they shouldn’t. The Public Library is the same as when you were a kid, that’s what makes them wonderful. They have earned you trust by staying the same. Institutions are not designed to change. They are designed to earn your trust. </p>

<p>Colleges are similar. They are accredited entities, legally authorized to exchange a degree for measurable mastery. If that gets compromised, we’re all out of a job. And that’s why they have Labs. </p>

<p>Show Business is in the business of taking risks on ideas. Let’s take some cues from them…</p>

<h1>1. This is Show Business</h1>

<h3>Events prototype a reality. </h3>

<p>They are shows. They start and end. </p>

<h3>Stand up a Production Company</h3>

<p>You have to create some sort of shell so you’re not acting on behalf of some part of the organization, just yourself. Instead of a “Lab,” or R &amp; D Group or something, think of yourself as a Production company. </p>

<p><strong>What’s a production company do…</strong></p>

<h3>Share the Wins + Shed the Losses</h3>

<p>We become an outsourced risk entity. </p>

<h1>2. Find Space in the Margins</h1>

<h3>Of Time: the Margins of the Academic Calendar</h3>

<h3>Of Institution: Work in the Margins of the Organization</h3>

<h3>Of the Curriculum: Work in the Margins of the Organization</h3>

<ul>
	<li>AC Reboot</li>
	<li>Hacking the Library</li>
</ul>

<h3>How about the Library?</h3>

<h1>3. Co-Create with Students</h1>

<h3>Or just give them the Keys</h3>

<p>SLAC, Stay Late and Create. </p>

<p>Began in Library </p>

<h1>4. Host Pop-Ups, Prototypes &amp; Parties</h1>

<p>There’s a skirting of politics with the impermanent and provisional. ACRONYM pops up, makes a convivial cafe, and is gone in three hours. </p>

<h2>Pop-Ups: ACRONYM</h2>

<h3>College Runs on Coffee</h3>

<p>Free Coffee! Wednesday’s 12:30-2pm, brewed &amp; served by students. Tea too. </p>

<p>Pour-over coffee at the front door of the College, poured by novice baristas’ having fun. It’s slow, inefficient and an enduring student-run production.</p>

<p>At first we thought this was a bug, turned out to be a feature. You don’t pay in money, you pay in time. Waiting in line together, talking. </p>

<p>Conversation!</p>

<h3>Popping Up in Public</h3>

<p>There’s a skirting of politics with impermanence. ACRONYM pops up, makes a convivial cafe, and is gone in three hours. </p>

<h2>Prototypes: The Library Circulation Desk</h2>

<h3>Nothing says temporary like cardboard furniture…</h3>

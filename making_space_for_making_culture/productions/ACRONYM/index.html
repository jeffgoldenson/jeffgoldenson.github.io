<h1>College Runs on Coffee</h1>

<h2>ACRONYM</h2>

<p>Free Coffee! Wednesday’s 12:30-2pm, brewed &amp; served by students. Tea too. </p>

<p>Pour-over coffee at the front door of the College, poured by novice baristas’ having fun. It’s slow, inefficient and an enduring student-run production.</p>

<p>At first we thought this was a bug, turned out to be a feature. You don’t pay in money, you pay in time. Waiting in line together, talking. </p>

<p>Conversation!</p>

<h2>Popping Up in Public</h2>

<p>There’s a skirting of politics with impermanence. ACRONYM popped up, had a party, and was out in a matter of three hours. </p>

<h2>Beginnings</h2>

<p>In 2015, we had a Faculty Retreat devoted to re-imagining the Library. I co-ran it with <a href="https://amhoov.org/">Aaron Hoover</a> and <a href="https://sarahendren.com/">Sara Hendren</a>. Sara named the gathering “<em>Making Space for Making Culture</em>,” she nailed it. </p>

<h3>more to come…</h3>

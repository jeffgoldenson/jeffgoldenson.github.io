<h2>College Runs on Coffe</h2>

<p>Free Coffee! Wednesday’s 12:30-2pm, brewed &amp; served by students. Tea too. </p>

<p>Pour-over coffee at the front door of the College, poured by novice baristas’ having fun. It’s slow, inefficient and an enduring student-run production.</p>

<p>At first we thought this was a bug, turned out to be a feature. You don’t pay in money, you pay in time. Waiting in line together, talking. </p>

<p>Conversation!</p>

<h2>Popping Up in Public</h2>

<p>There’s a skirting of politics with impermanence. ACRONYM pops up, makes a convivial cafe, and is gone in three hours. </p>

<h2>Making Space for Making Culture</h2>

<p>We needed the main floor of our library to open up &amp; welcome event production from across the college, depending on day, time, season. And then reset. We needed to “make” space to make culture. </p>

<p>So we put everything on wheels. regular castors, and step-down castors. There’s little special about this, other than we retrofitted our existing bookshelves with wheels. </p>

<p>We did it scrappy and it became a many hands Friday job. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bagelsaurus.com/#menu">Salt Bagels w/ Honey Rosemary Cream Cheese</a> were just a cameo for the bookshelf-making event. But they quickly became legend so we brought ‘em back about once a semester (at great expense) to play the staring role in our Community Breakfasts to kick off the Semester. But it was worth every penny. </p>
